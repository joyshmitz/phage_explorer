## Phage 101 for engineers (why this field is wild)

**What phages are (in engineering terms):** self-assembling nanosyringes that package code (DNA/RNA) in a protein shell, land on bacteria, and inject that code to hijack the host. They’re the most abundant biological “edge devices” on Earth (≈10³¹ particles), continuously stress‑testing bacterial firmware.

### Why people study them
- *Medicine*: design phage cocktails to beat antibiotic‑resistant infections.
- *Biotech*: workhorse enzymes (T7 RNA polymerase, Phi29 DNA pol) are phage gifts used in PCR, in‑vitro transcription, and genome amplification.
- *Evolution & ecology*: phages rewrite bacterial genomes, drive the ocean carbon cycle, and shape your gut microbiome.
- *Engineering playground*: modular genomes swap parts (tail fibers, lysis cassettes) like microservice plugins.

### How phages cracked the genetic code
- **Hershey–Chase blender experiment (1952)** used phage T2 to prove DNA is the hereditary material.
- **Crick–Brenner frameshift experiment (1961)** in phage T4 rII genes showed the code is read in *triplets*—delete/insert three bases and the protein still works.
- **Early codon assignments** relied on phage RNA/DNA templates (e.g., poly‑U/UGG) to map base triplets to amino acids, paving the way for the 64‑codon table we use today.

---

- **What they are:** Bacteriophages (“phages”) are bacteria‑infecting viruses. They self‑assemble into nanomachines with a head (capsid) that stores DNA/RNA and a tail that injects it like a syringe.
- **Why they matter today**
  - *Medicine*: design phage cocktails to beat antibiotic‑resistant infections.
  - *Biotech*: workhorse enzymes (T7 RNA polymerase, Phi29 DNA pol) are phage gifts used in PCR, in‑vitro transcription, and genome amplification.
  - *Evolution & ecology*: phages are the most abundant biological entities on Earth. They rewrite bacterial genomes, drive the ocean carbon cycle, and shape your gut microbiome.
- **Modular by design:** Phage genomes behave like Lego kits—swapping tail fibers, lysis cassettes, and regulatory modules across lineages. That modularity is exactly what Phage Explorer visualizes.
- **Historical impact:** Foundational experiments (Hershey–Chase blender test for DNA as genetic material; Luria–Delbrück fluctuation test revealing random mutation) used phages. They were also the playground for cracking the genetic code.

### Quick mental model for software folks
- **Genome = source code** (A/C/G/T chars) with strongly typed 3-char opcodes (codons).
- **Promoter/RBS = function entry points** that recruit ribosomes (the runtime) to start decoding.
- **Reading frame = instruction pointer alignment;** shift by one base and every downstream opcode changes.
- **Stop codons = return;** terminate translation and hand control back to the host.
- **Phage lifecycle = deployment strategy:** lytic = `rm -rf host`; lysogenic = `git clone` into host genome and wait.

## A 90‑second genetic code primer

- DNA alphabet: A, C, G, T (RNA swaps T→U). Proteins are chains of 20 amino acids.
- Translation reads DNA in **codons**—non‑overlapping triplets of bases (64 possible combos). Every three letters → one amino acid or a stop signal.
- The mapping is fixed and mostly redundant (“degenerate”): several codons can encode the same amino acid. Three codons encode **stop**, and ATG usually marks **start**.
- Reading frames matter: shift by one base and every downstream codon changes. Phage Explorer lets you flip frames live to see amino acid strings reflow.
- Triplets are proven by phage genetics: three-base indels restore the reading frame; doublet/singlet changes scramble everything.
- Quick lookup:

| Codon | Amino acid | Notes |
|-------|------------|-------|
| ATG   | M (Methionine) | Start codon |
| TTT / TTC | F (Phenylalanine) | Aromatic |
| GAA / GAG | E (Glutamic acid) | Acidic |
| TGG | W (Tryptophan) | Unique single-codon amino acid |
| TAA / TAG / TGA | * (Stop) | Terminates translation |

- **Chemistry buckets:** Amino acids group into hydrophobic, polar, acidic, basic, and “special” (glycine, proline, cysteine, histidine). Themes color by these groups so chemical patterns pop while you scroll.

## UI Design System

To keep 31+ planned features coherent, Phage Explorer follows a lightweight design system tailored for text UIs:

- **Color semantics**  
  - Green `#22c55e`: good / conserved / similar  
  - Yellow `#eab308`: caution / neutral  
  - Red `#ef4444`: warning / divergent  
  - Blue `#3b82f6`: informational metrics  
  - Purple `#a855f7`: notable / special  
  - Gray `#6b7280`: background / reference / inactive

- **Graph & sparkline standards**  
  - Height: 3–5 text rows; Width: terminal width where possible  
  - Auto-normalize values; show min/max in labels  
  - Prefer Braille dots for dense sparklines; fall back to ASCII if needed

- **Panels, modals, overlays**  
  - Single-line box borders, 1-char padding  
  - Headers bold, centered, include close hint (e.g., “Esc to close”)  
  - Max width 80 chars or `(terminal width - 4)`, whichever is smaller

- **Interaction “depth layers” (progressive disclosure)**  
  - Layer 0: Core always-on controls (navigation, view toggles, help, search)  
  - Layer 1: Quick overlays (single-key toggles; limit 3 active)  
  - Layer 2: Analysis menu (`A`) with numbered shortcuts + fuzzy search  
  - Layer 3: Simulation hub (`Shift+S`) for interactive models  
  - Layer 4: Command palette (`:` or `Ctrl+P`) that fuzzy-searches all actions

Use these conventions for any new component: pick colors from the palette above, respect padding/borders, and place advanced features in deeper layers so newcomers see a stable core UI.

---

## Depth Layers & Keybinding Conventions (progressive disclosure)

Phage Explorer serves both newcomers and power users by stacking features in “depth layers”:

- **Layer 0 – Sacred Surface (always available, never changed)**  
  Navigation: `↑` `↓` `←` `→` `PgUp` `PgDn` `Home` `End`  
  View: `N`/`C`/`Space` (DNA/AA), `F` (frame), `T` (theme), `D` (diff), `M` (3D model)  
  Meta: `?` (help), `S` or `/` (search), `Q` (quit)  
  These keys are stable forever; everything else builds on top.

- **Layer 1 – Quick Overlays (single-key toggles; max 3 active)**  
  Reserved keys: `G` (GC skew), `X` (complexity), `B` (bendability), `P` (promoter/RBS), `R` (repeats).  
  Data is precomputed on phage selection so toggles feel instant. (Feature hooks coming next.)

- **Layer 2 – Analysis Menu (`A`)**  
  Categorized, numbered actions (e.g., GC skew analysis, dot plots, codon dashboards). Supports fuzzy search.

- **Layer 3 – Simulation Hub (`Shift+S`)**  
  Full-screen interactive simulations (lysogeny circuits, ribosome traffic, plaque automata, etc.).

- **Layer 4 – Command Palette (`:` or `Ctrl+P`)**  
  Fuzzy-search every action; shows the shortcut path (e.g., “GC skew [G] Overlay” or “Dot plot [A→4] Analysis”).

Keystroke budget rule: Layer 0 keys are immutable; new features must live in higher layers. This keeps discoverability for beginners and speed for experts.

## Interactive Simulations (7)

The Simulation Hub (`Shift+S`) provides interactive models of phage biology with adjustable parameters and real-time visualization.

### 1. Lysogeny Decision Circuit
**Model:** ODE system of Lambda lysis-lysogeny bistable switch
**State variables:** CI and Cro repressor concentrations
**Parameters:**
- Hill cooperativity (n=1-4) — controls switch steepness
- MOI (multiplicity of infection) — tips balance toward lysogeny
- UV damage — triggers lytic induction

**Output:** Phase classification (lysogenic/lytic/undecided) with time-series history

### 2. Ribosome Traffic Simulator
**Model:** Particle-based translation with stochastic elongation
**Mechanics:**
- 9-codon ribosome footprint
- Elongation rates derived from phage codon usage bias
- Rare codons create traffic jams → bottlenecks

**Output:** Protein production rate, stall events, density heatmap

### 3. Plaque Growth Automata
**Model:** Cellular automaton with reaction-diffusion dynamics
**Cell states:** Empty → Bacteria → Infected → Lysed → Phage → Lysogen
**Parameters:** Burst size, latent period, diffusion probability, adsorption rate, lysogeny probability
**Grid:** Toroidal wrap-around, ~100 steps/frame

### 4. Burst Kinetics Simulator
**Model:** SIR-like ODE system (dB/dt, dI/dt, dP/dt)
**Features:**
- Adsorption kinetics: k [mL/(phage·min)]
- Exponential latent period decay
- Logistic bacterial growth with carrying capacity

### 5. Resistance Cocktail Evolution
**Model:** Gillespie stochastic simulation with tau-leaping

**Output:** Fill fraction, internal pressure (atm), motor force (pN)

### 7. Evolution Replay
**Model:** Molecular clock with mutations and genetic drift
**Mechanics:**
- Poisson-distributed mutations per generation
- Selection coefficients from normal distribution
- Fitness clamped 0.6-1.5, effective population (Ne) tracks drift

## WASM Acceleration

Performance-critical algorithms are implemented in Rust and compiled to WebAssembly for near-native speed in the browser.

### What's Accelerated

| Algorithm | Threshold | Speedup | Fallback |
|-----------|-----------|---------|----------|
| **PCA (Power Iteration)** | 20K+ elements | ~10-50x | Pure JS eigendecomposition |
| **Spatial Hash Bond Detection** | Always | 1000x vs O(N²) | — |
| **K-mer Counting** | Large genomes | ~5x | TypedArray JS |

### Spatial Hash: Why It Matters

Traditional bond detection is O(N²)—checking every atom pair. For a 50,000-atom structure, that's 2.5 billion comparisons.

The WASM spatial hash:
1. Divides 3D space into grid cells (cell size = max bond length)
2. Each atom only checks neighbors in adjacent cells
3. Reduces to O(N) on average

**Result:** 50K atoms in <1s vs 60s+ naive. This enables real-time structure exploration.

### Automatic Fallback

When WASM isn't available (older browsers, restricted environments), Phage Explorer gracefully falls back to pure JavaScript implementations. Users get the same features, just slower on large datasets.

---

## Precomputed Annotations

The SQLite database includes extensive precomputed annotations, enabling instant analysis with zero latency.

### Database Schema

| Table | Contents |
|-------|----------|
| `phages` | 24 reference phages with metadata (accession, family, genus, host, morphology, lifecycle, genome stats) |
| `sequences` | Chunked 10kb segments for virtualized streaming |
| `genes` | Full annotations (position, strand, type, qualifiers as JSON) |
| `codonUsage` | Per-phage amino acid and codon frequency counts |
| `proteinDomains` | Pfam/SMART/CDD domains with E-values and boundaries |
| `foldEmbeddings` | ESM2 protein embeddings as Float32 blobs |
| `amgAnnotations` | Auxiliary metabolic genes linked to KEGG pathways |
| `defenseSystems` | Anti-CRISPR/anti-RM/anti-Abi predictions with confidence |
| `tropismPredictions` | Tail fiber receptor binding (ML-derived) |
| `codonAdaptation` | CAI, tAI, CPB, Nc' per phage-host pair |

### Annotation Pipeline

Annotations are precomputed via GitHub Actions:
1. **NCBI fetch** → Raw sequences and gene annotations
2. **Pfam/InterPro scan** → Protein domain identification
3. **KEGG mapping** → Metabolic pathway linkage
4. **ESM2 inference** → Protein fold embeddings
5. **SQLite build** → Indexed, compressed database (~6MB)

Users get instant results because all heavy computation happens at build time.

---

## Alignment-Free Genomics

Traditional sequence comparison requires alignment (BLAST, etc.), which is slow and fails for distant homologs. Phage Explorer includes alignment-free methods that work on raw k-mer statistics.

### Chaos Game Representation (CGR)

Maps a genome to a 2D fractal image:
- Start at center (0.5, 0.5)
- For each nucleotide, move halfway toward its corner
- Plot the point

**Result:** A unique "fingerprint" where similar genomes produce similar fractals. Visually identifies sequence biases, repeat structures, and phylogenetic relationships without alignment.

### K-mer PCA

1. Compute tetranucleotide (4-mer) frequency vectors (256 dimensions)
2. Run PCA to reduce to 2-3D
3. Cluster phages by genomic signature

**Why it works:** Oligonucleotide frequencies are remarkably stable within a genome but differ between species. This captures "genomic dialect" independent of gene order or alignment.

### Recombination Radar

Detects horizontal gene transfer and mosaic genomes:
1. Slide a window across the query genome
2. Compute k-mer Jaccard similarity to each reference
3. Plot "donor" assignment along the genome

**Output:** Identifies breakpoints where the genome switches from one "parent" to another—direct evidence of recombination events.

## Why Phage Explorer Exists

Most phage genomics tools are either:
- **Too specialized** — Built for one analysis type, require pipeline assembly
- **Too heavyweight** — Need cloud infrastructure, accounts, or complex installation
- **Too dated** — Command-line tools from the 2000s with no visualization

Phage Explorer combines:
- **Breadth** — 25+ analyses in one interface
- **Speed** — Precomputed annotations + WASM = instant results
- **Accessibility** — Single binary or web app, zero configuration
- **Education** — Interactive simulations teach the biology, not just display data

It's designed for the researcher who wants to *explore* a phage genome, not run a production pipeline.

## Rendering Pipeline

### Sequence Grid Virtualization

Phage Explorer handles genomes up to 500kb+ without loading the entire sequence into memory.

**How it works:**
1. Sequences stored in 10kb chunks in SQLite
2. Virtual window tracks visible region + 500bp overscan buffer
3. Only visible chunks loaded and rendered
4. Row tiles cached with content hashing—scroll reuses existing tiles
5. Incremental blitting renders only newly visible rows

**GlyphAtlas optimization:**
- Pre-renders all nucleotides and amino acids to a texture atlas
- 10x faster than calling `fillText()` per character
- O(1) array-based glyph lookup (not `Map.get()`)
- Automatic device pixel ratio scaling (1x to 3x)

**Zoom levels:**
| Preset | Cell Size | Use Case |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| Genome | 1px | Full genome overview |
| Micro | 4px | Regional patterns |
| Region | 8px | Gene-level navigation |
| Codon | 12px | Reading codons |
| Base | 18px | Individual nucleotides |

### 3D Rendering

**ASCII Renderer (TUI):**
- 70-character gradient for smooth shading: `.'-",:;Il!i><~+_-?][}{1)(|\/tfjrxnuvczXYUJCLQ0OZmwqpdbkhao*#MW&8%B@$`
- Float32 Z-buffer for proper occlusion
- Cohen-Sutherland line clipping with z-interpolation
- Front-to-back edge sorting for optimal depth writes
- Brightness mapping: depth → 0.2-1.0 intensity range

**WebGL Renderer (Web):**
- Real PDB structures fetched from RCSB
- Three render modes: cartoon ribbons, ball-and-stick, surface mesh
- CRT post-processing: chromatic aberration, scanlines, bloom, vignette, film grain
- O(N) spatial-hash bond detection for 50K+ atom structures

## Color Theme System

8 scientifically-grounded themes, each with 40+ color tokens.

### Amino Acid Color Logic

Colors map to biochemical properties so structural patterns are visible while scrolling:

| Property | Amino Acids | Color Family | Rationale |
|----------|-------------|--------------|-----------|
| **Hydrophobic** | V, L, I, M, F, W | Blues/Purples | Nonpolar, buried in core |
| **Polar** | S, T, N, Q | Cyans/Teals | OH/NH₂ side chains |
| **Positive** | K, R, H | Blues | Basic, cationic |
| **Negative** | D, E | Reds | Acidic, anionic |
| **Special** | C, P, G, A | Yellows/Silvers | Unique structural roles |
| **Stop** | * | Bright Red | Termination signal |

### Available Themes

1. **Holographic** (default) — Glassmorphic cyan/magenta, electric accents
2. **Cyberpunk** — Neon grid aesthetic (cyan/magenta/yellow)
3. **Classic** — Traditional bioinformatics (green A, blue C, amber G, red T)
4. **Ocean** — Cool water-inspired blues and teals
5. **Matrix** — Green monochrome terminal aesthetic
6. **Sunset** — Warm orange/red/gold gradient
7. **Forest** — Natural greens and earth tones
8. **Monochrome** — Accessibility-focused grayscale

## Mobile UX

Phage Explorer is fully touch-optimized with gesture navigation and haptic feedback.

### Touch Gestures

| Gesture | Action |
|---------|--------|
| **Swipe left/right** | Navigate between phages (spring physics animation) |
| **Pinch** | Zoom sequence grid between presets |
| **Long press** | Context menu with progressive haptic buildup |
| **Pull down** | Refresh/reload data |

### Haptic Feedback Patterns

9 distinct vibration patterns for tactile feedback:

| Pattern | Duration | Use |
|---------|----------|-----|
| `light` | 10ms | Selections, toggles |
| `medium` | 25ms | Button presses |
| `heavy` | 50ms | Important actions |
| `success` | 15-50-25ms | Task completion |
| `warning` | 30-80-30ms | Destructive action alert |
| `error` | 50-100-50-100-50ms | Triple buzz for errors |
| `tick` | 3ms | Slider/picker scrubbing |

Haptics respect `prefers-reduced-motion` and gracefully degrade on unsupported devices.

### Bottom Sheets

Mobile overlays use iOS-style bottom sheets:
- Snap points: 25%, 50%, 90% of screen height
- Drag handle with visual feedback
- Swipe-to-dismiss with velocity detection
- Safe area insets for notched devices

## Overlay Architecture

30+ analysis overlays, architected for performance and maintainability.

### Code Splitting

**Eager-loaded (instant):** Search, Help, Settings, Command Palette
**Lazy-loaded (on-demand):** All analysis overlays via React Suspense

This keeps initial bundle small (~200KB) while supporting 30+ feature-rich overlays.

### Overlay Categories

| Category | Overlays |
|----------|----------|
| **Sequence** | GC Skew, Complexity, Bendability, Promoter, Repeats, K-mer Anomaly |
| **Visualization** | CGR Fractal, Hilbert Curve, Dot Plot, Phase Portrait, Logo Plot |
| **Genomic** | HGT Detection, CRISPR Systems, Non-B DNA, Prophage Excision |
| **Protein** | Codon Bias, Domains, Fold Viewer, RNA Structure |
| **Ecology** | Host Tropism, Defense Arms Race, AMG Pathways, Cocktail Compatibility |
| **Simulation** | All 7 interactive simulations |

### Composable UI Primitives

Overlays share 12+ reusable components:
- `OverlaySection` / `OverlaySectionHeader` — Consistent section styling
- `OverlayGrid` / `OverlayRow` — Responsive layouts
- `OverlayStatCard` / `OverlayStatGrid` — Metric displays
- `OverlayKeyValue` / `OverlayBadge` — Data presentation
- `OverlayLegend` — Color key explanations

## State Management

Zustand powers all UI state, shared between TUI and web platforms.

### Store Structure

The `PhageExplorerStore` manages ~170 state properties:

| Domain | Properties |
|--------|------------|
| **Navigation** | Current phage, scroll position, zoom level |
| **View** | DNA/AA mode, reading frame, active theme |
| **Overlays** | Overlay stack (max 3), overlay-specific data |
| **Simulations** | Active simulation, parameters, history |
| **User** | Experience level, completed tours, preferences |

### Key Patterns

**Overlay stack limit:**
```typescript
overlays: [...filtered, newOverlay].slice(-3) // Max 3 active
```

**View mode scroll preservation:**
- DNA→AA: `scrollPosition / 3` (codons are 3bp)
- AA→DNA: `scrollPosition * 3`

**LocalStorage persistence:** Beginner mode, tour completion, theme preference

## Data Pipeline

### NCBI Integration

The data pipeline fetches sequences from NCBI's Entrez API:

1. **ESearch** — Query nucleotide database with filters
2. **ESummary** — Batch metadata retrieval (50 items/request)
3. **EFetch** — Full GenBank records with gene annotations

**Filters applied:**
- `viruses[filter] OR phage[Title]`
- Sequence length constraints
- Collection date for temporal analysis

### Transformations

| Step | Input | Output |
|------|-------|--------|
| **Normalization** | Raw FASTA | Uppercase, N-padded |
| **Chunking** | Full sequence | 10kb segments |
| **Translation** | DNA chunks | 6-frame amino acids |
| **Annotation** | GenBank features | Structured gene records |
| **Domain scan** | Protein sequences | Pfam/InterPro hits |
| **Embedding** | Protein sequences | ESM2 fold vectors |

### Phylodynamics Support

For temporal analysis, the pipeline:
- Parses collection dates (ISO, "May-2020", "2020", etc.)
- Bins sequences by month/year
- Extracts geographic metadata
- Computes temporal coverage histograms
