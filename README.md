## Phage 101 for engineers (why this field is wild)

**What phages are (in engineering terms):** self-assembling nanosyringes that package code (DNA/RNA) in a protein shell, land on bacteria, and inject that code to hijack the host. They’re the most abundant biological “edge devices” on Earth (≈10³¹ particles), continuously stress‑testing bacterial firmware.

### Why people study them
- *Medicine*: design phage cocktails to beat antibiotic‑resistant infections.
- *Biotech*: workhorse enzymes (T7 RNA polymerase, Phi29 DNA pol) are phage gifts used in PCR, in‑vitro transcription, and genome amplification.
- *Evolution & ecology*: phages rewrite bacterial genomes, drive the ocean carbon cycle, and shape your gut microbiome.
- *Engineering playground*: modular genomes swap parts (tail fibers, lysis cassettes) like microservice plugins.

### How phages cracked the genetic code
- **Hershey–Chase blender experiment (1952)** used phage T2 to prove DNA is the hereditary material.
- **Crick–Brenner frameshift experiment (1961)** in phage T4 rII genes showed the code is read in *triplets*—delete/insert three bases and the protein still works.
- **Early codon assignments** relied on phage RNA/DNA templates (e.g., poly‑U/UGG) to map base triplets to amino acids, paving the way for the 64‑codon table we use today.

---

- **What they are:** Bacteriophages (“phages”) are bacteria‑infecting viruses. They self‑assemble into nanomachines with a head (capsid) that stores DNA/RNA and a tail that injects it like a syringe.
- **Why they matter today**
  - *Medicine*: design phage cocktails to beat antibiotic‑resistant infections.
  - *Biotech*: workhorse enzymes (T7 RNA polymerase, Phi29 DNA pol) are phage gifts used in PCR, in‑vitro transcription, and genome amplification.
  - *Evolution & ecology*: phages are the most abundant biological entities on Earth. They rewrite bacterial genomes, drive the ocean carbon cycle, and shape your gut microbiome.
- **Modular by design:** Phage genomes behave like Lego kits—swapping tail fibers, lysis cassettes, and regulatory modules across lineages. That modularity is exactly what Phage Explorer visualizes.
- **Historical impact:** Foundational experiments (Hershey–Chase blender test for DNA as genetic material; Luria–Delbrück fluctuation test revealing random mutation) used phages. They were also the playground for cracking the genetic code.

### Quick mental model for software folks
- **Genome = source code** (A/C/G/T chars) with strongly typed 3-char opcodes (codons).
- **Promoter/RBS = function entry points** that recruit ribosomes (the runtime) to start decoding.
- **Reading frame = instruction pointer alignment;** shift by one base and every downstream opcode changes.
- **Stop codons = return;** terminate translation and hand control back to the host.
- **Phage lifecycle = deployment strategy:** lytic = `rm -rf host`; lysogenic = `git clone` into host genome and wait.

## A 90‑second genetic code primer

- DNA alphabet: A, C, G, T (RNA swaps T→U). Proteins are chains of 20 amino acids.
- Translation reads DNA in **codons**—non‑overlapping triplets of bases (64 possible combos). Every three letters → one amino acid or a stop signal.
- The mapping is fixed and mostly redundant (“degenerate”): several codons can encode the same amino acid. Three codons encode **stop**, and ATG usually marks **start**.
- Reading frames matter: shift by one base and every downstream codon changes. Phage Explorer lets you flip frames live to see amino acid strings reflow.
- Triplets are proven by phage genetics: three-base indels restore the reading frame; doublet/singlet changes scramble everything.
- Quick lookup:

| Codon | Amino acid | Notes |
|-------|------------|-------|
| ATG   | M (Methionine) | Start codon |
| TTT / TTC | F (Phenylalanine) | Aromatic |
| GAA / GAG | E (Glutamic acid) | Acidic |
| TGG | W (Tryptophan) | Unique single-codon amino acid |
| TAA / TAG / TGA | * (Stop) | Terminates translation |

- **Chemistry buckets:** Amino acids group into hydrophobic, polar, acidic, basic, and “special” (glycine, proline, cysteine, histidine). Themes color by these groups so chemical patterns pop while you scroll.

```bash
# Install latest release (includes database)
curl -fsSL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dicklesworthstone/phage_explorer/main/install.sh?$(date +%s)" | bash -s -- --with-database

# Run
phage-explorer
```

### Option 2: Build from Source

```bash
# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/phage_explorer.git
cd phage_explorer
bun install

# Build the phage database (fetches from NCBI, ~1 minute)
bun run build:db

# Run the TUI
bun run dev
```

## UI Design System

To keep 31+ planned features coherent, Phage Explorer follows a lightweight design system tailored for text UIs:

- **Color semantics**  
  - Green `#22c55e`: good / conserved / similar  
  - Yellow `#eab308`: caution / neutral  
  - Red `#ef4444`: warning / divergent  
  - Blue `#3b82f6`: informational metrics  
  - Purple `#a855f7`: notable / special  
  - Gray `#6b7280`: background / reference / inactive

- **Graph & sparkline standards**  
  - Height: 3–5 text rows; Width: terminal width where possible  
  - Auto-normalize values; show min/max in labels  
  - Prefer Braille dots for dense sparklines; fall back to ASCII if needed

- **Panels, modals, overlays**  
  - Single-line box borders, 1-char padding  
  - Headers bold, centered, include close hint (e.g., “Esc to close”)  
  - Max width 80 chars or `(terminal width - 4)`, whichever is smaller

- **Interaction “depth layers” (progressive disclosure)**  
  - Layer 0: Core always-on controls (navigation, view toggles, help, search)  
  - Layer 1: Quick overlays (single-key toggles; limit 3 active)  
  - Layer 2: Analysis menu (`A`) with numbered shortcuts + fuzzy search  
  - Layer 3: Simulation hub (`Shift+S`) for interactive models  
  - Layer 4: Command palette (`:` or `Ctrl+P`) that fuzzy-searches all actions

Use these conventions for any new component: pick colors from the palette above, respect padding/borders, and place advanced features in deeper layers so newcomers see a stable core UI.

---

## Depth Layers & Keybinding Conventions (progressive disclosure)

Phage Explorer serves both newcomers and power users by stacking features in “depth layers”:

- **Layer 0 – Sacred Surface (always available, never changed)**  
  Navigation: `↑` `↓` `←` `→` `PgUp` `PgDn` `Home` `End`  
  View: `N`/`C`/`Space` (DNA/AA), `F` (frame), `T` (theme), `D` (diff), `M` (3D model)  
  Meta: `?` (help), `S` or `/` (search), `Q` (quit)  
  These keys are stable forever; everything else builds on top.

- **Layer 1 – Quick Overlays (single-key toggles; max 3 active)**  
  Reserved keys: `G` (GC skew), `X` (complexity), `B` (bendability), `P` (promoter/RBS), `R` (repeats).  
  Data is precomputed on phage selection so toggles feel instant. (Feature hooks coming next.)

- **Layer 2 – Analysis Menu (`A`)**  
  Categorized, numbered actions (e.g., GC skew analysis, dot plots, codon dashboards). Supports fuzzy search.

- **Layer 3 – Simulation Hub (`Shift+S`)**  
  Full-screen interactive simulations (lysogeny circuits, ribosome traffic, plaque automata, etc.).

- **Layer 4 – Command Palette (`:` or `Ctrl+P`)**  
  Fuzzy-search every action; shows the shortcut path (e.g., “GC skew [G] Overlay” or “Dot plot [A→4] Analysis”).

Keystroke budget rule: Layer 0 keys are immutable; new features must live in higher layers. This keeps discoverability for beginners and speed for experts.

- **Open source**: Full source code available for audit

---

## Performance Notes

- Single-binary distribution, no runtime dependencies
- SQLite database for instant local queries
- Virtualized sequence rendering for genomes up to 500kb+
- Chunked fetching avoids loading entire genomes into memory
- 3D model rendering at ~20fps with minimal CPU usage
- **WASM spatial-hash**: O(N) bond detection vs O(N²) naive—1000x faster for large structures (50K atoms: <1s vs 60s+)
- Web Worker isolation keeps UI responsive during heavy computation
- Automatic fallback to pure JS when WASM unavailable

---

## CI/CD

- **Lint + Typecheck**: Every push and PR
- **Cross-platform builds**: macOS (arm64, x64), Linux (x64, arm64), Windows (x64)
- **Automated releases**: Tagged versions trigger binary builds and GitHub release
- **Database artifacts**: Pre-built `phage.db` included in releases

## Development

1. `bun install` to set up dependencies
2. `bun run build:db` to create the database
3. `bun run dev` to run the TUI
