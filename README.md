## What are phages, and why do they matter?

- **Bacteriophages (phages)** are viruses that infect bacteria. They are the most abundant biological entities on Earth and shape microbial ecosystems, the ocean carbon cycle, and your own microbiome.
- **Why people study them**
  - Medicine: craft phage cocktails to fight antibiotic‑resistant infections.
  - Biotechnology: enzymes like T7 RNA polymerase and Phi29 polymerase are phage gifts that power PCR, IVT, and genome amplification.
  - Evolution: phages are modular, recombining “Lego kits” that swap genes and reveal how genomes evolve.
- **Historical impact:** Classic phage experiments (Hershey–Chase, Luria–Delbrück) established DNA as genetic material and the statistical nature of mutation. Phages helped crack the genetic code and seeded modern molecular biology.

## A 90‑second genetic code primer

- DNA alphabet: A, C, G, T (RNA uses U instead of T).
- The code is read in **codons**: non‑overlapping triplets of bases.
- Each codon maps to an amino acid (or a stop signal). Example:

| Codon | Amino acid | Notes |
|-------|------------|-------|
| ATG   | M (Methionine) | Start codon |
| TTT / TTC | F (Phenylalanine) | Aromatic |
| GAA / GAG | E (Glutamic acid) | Acidic |
| TGG | W (Tryptophan) | Unique single-codon amino acid |
| TAA / TAG / TGA | * (Stop) | Terminates translation |

- **Reading frames matter:** shift the starting base by 1 or 2 and every downstream codon changes. Phage Explorer lets you flip frames and watch amino acid strings update instantly.
- **Color hints:** Amino acids cluster by chemistry (hydrophobic, polar, acidic, basic, special). Themes use those groups so patterns pop visually while you scroll.

## Color Themes

Cycle through themes with `T`:

- **Classic** — Traditional bioinformatics colors (green A, blue C, amber G, red T)
- **Ocean** — Cool blue/teal palette
- **Matrix** — Green terminal aesthetic
- **Sunset** — Warm orange/coral tones
- **Forest** — Natural earth greens and browns

Each theme provides distinct colors for:
- 4 nucleotides (A, C, G, T) + N
- 20 amino acids grouped by property (hydrophobic, polar, acidic, basic, special) + stop codon

## UI Design System (for contributors)

To keep 31+ planned features coherent, Phage Explorer follows a lightweight design system tailored for text UIs:

- **Color semantics**  
  - Green `#22c55e`: good / conserved / similar  
  - Yellow `#eab308`: caution / neutral  
  - Red `#ef4444`: warning / divergent  
  - Blue `#3b82f6`: informational metrics  
  - Purple `#a855f7`: notable / special  
  - Gray `#6b7280`: background / reference / inactive

- **Graph & sparkline standards**  
  - Height: 3–5 text rows; Width: terminal width where possible  
  - Auto-normalize values; show min/max in labels  
  - Prefer Braille dots for dense sparklines; fall back to ASCII if needed

- **Panels, modals, overlays**  
  - Single-line box borders, 1-char padding  
  - Headers bold, centered, include close hint (e.g., “Esc to close”)  
  - Max width 80 chars or `(terminal width - 4)`, whichever is smaller

- **Interaction “depth layers” (progressive disclosure)**  
  - Layer 0: Core always-on controls (navigation, view toggles, help, search)  
  - Layer 1: Quick overlays (single-key toggles; limit 3 active)  
  - Layer 2: Analysis menu (`A`) with numbered shortcuts + fuzzy search  
  - Layer 3: Simulation hub (`Shift+S`) for interactive models  
  - Layer 4: Command palette (`:` or `Ctrl+P`) that fuzzy-searches all actions

Use these conventions for any new component: pick colors from the palette above, respect padding/borders, and place advanced features in deeper layers so newcomers see a stable core UI.

## Depth Layers & Keybinding Conventions (progressive disclosure)

Phage Explorer serves both newcomers and power users by stacking features in “depth layers”:

- **Layer 0 – Sacred Surface (always available, never changed)**  
  Navigation: `↑` `↓` `←` `→` `PgUp` `PgDn` `Home` `End`  
  View: `N`/`C`/`Space` (DNA/AA), `F` (frame), `T` (theme), `D` (diff), `M` (3D model)  
  Meta: `?` (help), `S` or `/` (search), `Q` (quit)  
  These keys are stable forever; everything else builds on top.

- **Layer 1 – Quick Overlays (single-key toggles; max 3 active)**  
  Reserved keys: `G` (GC skew), `X` (complexity), `B` (bendability), `P` (promoter/RBS), `R` (repeats).  
  Data is precomputed on phage selection so toggles feel instant. (Feature hooks coming next.)

- **Layer 2 – Analysis Menu (`A`)**  
  Categorized, numbered actions (e.g., GC skew analysis, dot plots, codon dashboards). Supports fuzzy search.

- **Layer 3 – Simulation Hub (`Shift+S`)**  
  Full-screen interactive simulations (lysogeny circuits, ribosome traffic, plaque automata, etc.).

- **Layer 4 – Command Palette (`:` or `Ctrl+P`)**  
  Fuzzy-search every action; shows the shortcut path (e.g., “GC skew [G] Overlay” or “Dot plot [A→4] Analysis”).

Keystroke budget rule: Layer 0 keys are immutable; new features must live in higher layers. This keeps discoverability for beginners and speed for experts.
