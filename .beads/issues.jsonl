{"id":"phage_explorer-0k6","title":"Layer 3: Temporal Evolution Replay","description":"## Temporal Evolution Replay (Layer 3 Simulation)\n\n### Concept\n\nEvolution is not a photograph — it's a **movie**. When we have multiple isolates of related phages collected over time (e.g., longitudinal coevolution studies, historical laboratory stocks), we can reconstruct **how the genome changed through time**.\n\nThis feature creates an **animated time-lapse of evolution**, showing:\n- When and where each mutation appeared\n- How **effective population size (Ne)** changed (population dynamics)\n- The **substitution rate** (molecular clock calibration)\n- Branches where lineages diverged\n\nThe key mathematical tool is the **dated phylogenetic tree** — a tree where branch lengths are calibrated to real time rather than genetic distance. Combined with ancestral sequence reconstruction, we can \"play back\" evolution.\n\n### Mathematical Foundations\n\n**Molecular Clock Hypothesis:**\n```\nSubstitutions accumulate at roughly constant rate:\n  genetic_distance ≈ μ × t × 2  (for two taxa)\nWhere:\n  μ = substitution rate (subs/site/year)\n  t = divergence time\nFor phages: μ ≈ 10⁻⁵ to 10⁻³ subs/site/year (much faster than most organisms)\n```\n\n**Root-to-tip Regression (clock test):**\n```\nFor each taxon i with sampling date tᵢ:\n  dᵢ = genetic distance from root to tip\nLinear regression: dᵢ = μ × tᵢ + c\nGood clock: R² > 0.8, p < 0.05\ntMRCA = -c / μ (time to most recent common ancestor)\n```\n\n**Least-Squares Dating (LSD2 algorithm):**\n```\nGiven unrooted tree T with branch lengths and tip dates {t₁...tₙ}:\nMinimize: Σᵢⱼ (dᵢⱼ - |tᵢ - tⱼ|×μ)²\nSubject to: all internal node dates < descendant dates\nOutput: Dated tree with internal node dates\n```\n\n**Coalescent Skyline (Population Dynamics):**\n```\nE[waiting time for k → k-1 lineages] = Ne × 2 / (k(k-1))\nSkyline plot: Estimate Ne at each coalescent interval\nReveals population crashes (bottlenecks) and expansions\n```\n\n**Ancestral Sequence Reconstruction (Felsenstein):**\n```\nMaximum Likelihood at each internal node:\nP(node = A) = Σₓ P(left=x|node=A) × P(right=y|node=A) × P(A→x) × P(A→y)\nMarginal reconstruction: Most likely state at each position\n```\n\n### Implementation Approach\n\n**Core interfaces:**\n```typescript\ninterface DatedSequence {\n  id: string;\n  sequence: string;\n  collectionDate: Date;\n  location?: string;\n}\n\ninterface ClockAnalysis {\n  rate: number;              // subs/site/year\n  rateCI: [number, number];  // 95% CI\n  tmrca: Date;               // Time to MRCA\n  r2: number;                // Regression fit\n  clockLike: boolean;        // Is clock model appropriate?\n}\n\ninterface DatedTree {\n  tree: NewickTree;\n  nodeHeights: Map<string, number>;  // Node ID -> date\n  rate: number;\n}\n\ninterface AncestralReconstruction {\n  nodeSequences: Map<string, string>;\n  mutations: MutationEvent[];\n  confidence: Map<string, Float32Array>;\n}\n\ninterface EvolutionFrame {\n  time: number;\n  displayDate: string;\n  sequence: string;\n  mutations: { position: number; from: string; to: string }[];\n  activeBranches: string[];\n  neAtTime: number;\n  cumulativeMutations: number;\n}\n```\n\n**Animation frame generator** yields frames for smooth playback with mutations appearing at interpolated times.\n\n### TUI Visualization\n\n```\nTemporal Evolution Replay: Lambda isolates (1950-2020)\n═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\n\nTime: ████████████████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░  1985-03-12\n      1950                     2020\n\nTree (branches alive highlighted):\n                ┌──● Lambda-1950 (ancestor)\n            ┌───┤\n        ┌───┤   └──○ Lambda-1962\n    ────┤   └──────────● Lambda-1985 ← YOU ARE HERE\n        └──────────────────○ Lambda-2020 (future)\n\nSequence at 1985-03-12:\nPosition:  12450  12451  12452  12453\nAncestral:   A      T      G      C\nCurrent:     A      T      C*     C    ← MUTATION!

Biologists think in years.\n2. **Coevolution studies**: Phage-bacteria arms races occur over weeks to months. Animation reveals dynamics.\n3. **Outbreak forensics**: For phage therapy monitoring, knowing *when* resistance arose helps understand failures.\n4. **Educational power**: Nothing conveys \"evolution is ongoing\" like watching mutations accumulate.\n5. **Population dynamics**: Ne skyline reveals bottlenecks and expansions — demographic history of the phage.\n\n### Innovation Assessment\n\n**Novelty: HIGH** - Time-tree tools exist (BEAST, TreeTime, LSD2), but no interactive animated TUI visualization. \"Time scrubber\" interface is completely novel.\n\n**Pedagogical Value: 10/10** - Teaches molecular clocks, phylogenetic dating, coalescent theory, ancestral reconstruction, population dynamics.\n\n**Wow Factor: 10/10** - Watching mutations appear one by one as timeline advances — seeing the \"ghost\" of ancestral sequence transform into modern isolate — is genuinely mesmerizing.\n\n### Data Requirements\n- Multiple dated isolate sequences (FASTA + dates)\n- At least 5-10 isolates spanning time range\n- Good temporal signal (clock-like evolution)","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-12-07T04:17:53.647084Z","updated_at":"2025-12-07T18:42:40.500140Z","closed_at":"2025-12-07T18:42:40.500140Z","compaction_level":0,"original_size":0,"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"phage_explorer-0k6","depends_on_id":"phage_explorer-ojb","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-26T01:12:18Z","created_by":"import"}]}

This is the visual heart of the application.\n\n## Why This Matters\nThe sequence grid is the most frequently viewed component. Users scroll through thousands of bases constantly. Any frame drops or latency destroys the \"instant feedback\" experience that defines Phage Explorer.\n\n## Design Philosophy\nWe render to Canvas 2D (not DOM) because:\n1. **Performance**: DOM cannot achieve 60fps with 5000+ colored elements\n2. **Control**: Pixel-perfect cyberpunk aesthetics\n3. **Consistency**: Same visual output across browsers\n\nWebGL is used for post-processing effects (glow, scanlines) that would be expensive in 2D.\n\n## Deliverables\n1. **Canvas Sequence Grid Renderer** - Main rendering engine\n2. **Glyph Atlas** - Pre-rendered character sprites\n3. **Virtual Scrolling** - Efficient rendering of 100k+ sequences\n4. **Gene Map Renderer** - Canvas/SVG hybrid\n5. **Sparkline Components** - Ported from TUI\n6. **WebGL Post-Processing** - Shaders for effects\n\n## Technical Architecture\n\n### SequenceGridRenderer\n```typescript\n- OffscreenCanvas double-buffering\n- High-DPI support (devicePixelRatio)\n- Dirty region tracking for partial updates\n- Color batching (group characters by color)\n- requestAnimationFrame scheduling\n```\n\n### GlyphAtlas\n```typescript\n- Pre-render all nucleotides (ACGTN) + amino acids\n- Single canvas texture for all characters\n- drawGlyph() copies from atlas to destination\n- ~10x faster than fillText() per character\n```\n\n### Virtual Scrolling\n```typescript\n- Only render visible rows + overscan\n- Smooth scroll with momentum physics\n- Prefetch ahead of scroll direction\n- 60fps target with 100k+ bases\n```\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] 60fps scrolling on 100k+ base sequences\n- [ ] All nucleotide/amino acid colors match TUI\n- [ ] Gene map shows correct positions and strands\n- [ ] Scanlines and glow effects render correctly\n- [ ] High-DPI displays render crisply\n- [ ] Memory usage stable during extended scrolling\n\n## Performance Targets\n| Metric | Target |\n|--------|--------|\n| Frame time | <16.67ms |\n| First paint | <100ms |\n| Scroll latency | <8ms |\n| Memory (100k seq) | <50MB |\n\n## Risks & Mitigations\n- **Risk**: Canvas performance varies across browsers\n  - **Mitigation**: Test Safari, use conservative techniques\n- **Risk**: Glyph atlas memory\n  - **Mitigation**: Generate at runtime, don't ship as image\n- **Risk**: WebGL shader complexity\n  - **Mitigation**: Simple shaders first, optimize later\n\n## Dependencies\n- Phase 0 (app scaffold with theme system)\n- Phase 1 (database for sequence data)","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-12-07T21:56:14.282689Z","updated_at":"2025-12-07T23:04:37.240754Z","closed_at":"2025-12-07T23:04:37.240754Z","compaction_level":0,"original_size":0,"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"phage_explorer-10p","depends_on_id":"phage_explorer-87z","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-26T01:12:18Z","created_by":"import"},{"issue_id":"phage_explorer-10p","depends_on_id":"phage_explorer-pml","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-26T01:12:18Z","created_by":"import"}]}

Some interfere through:\n- **Superinfection exclusion (Sie)**: One phage blocks another from entering\n- **Receptor competition**: Both need same receptor (one wins)\n- **Lysis timing conflicts**: Different burst schedules cause resource waste\n- **Immunity/Lysogeny**: Temperate phage provides immunity against related phages\n\nThis feature computes a **compatibility matrix** across all phages and solves the **optimal cocktail selection problem**: find the minimal set covering target host range with no compatibility conflicts.\n\n### Mathematical Foundations\n\n**Compatibility scoring:**\n```\nFor phages A and B, compatibility score C(A,B) ∈ [-1, +1]:\n\nPositive factors (synergy):\n  - Different receptors: +0.3\n  - Different lysis timing (early + late): +0.2\n  - Complementary host ranges: +0.3\n  - No sequence homology in immunity regions: +0.2\n\nNegative factors (interference):\n  - Same receptor: -0.4\n  - Superinfection exclusion genes detected: -0.5\n  - Similar lysis timing: -0.2\n  - Sie genes present in both: -0.3\n  - One temperate provides immunity to other: -0.8\n\nC(A,B) = Σ positive_factors - Σ negative_factors (clamped to [-1, +1])\n```\n\n**Host range coverage:**\n```\nLet H = {h₁, h₂, ..., hₘ} = target hosts\nLet P = {p₁, p₂, ..., pₙ} = candidate phages\nLet R[i,j] = 1 if phage pᵢ infects host hⱼ, else 0\n\nCoverage of subset S ⊆ P:\n  Cov(S) = { hⱼ : ∃ pᵢ ∈ S with R[i,j] = 1 }\n```\n\n**Optimal cocktail as Set Cover + Compatibility (NP-hard):**\n```\nMaximize: |Cov(S)| (hosts covered)\nSubject to:\n  |S| ≤ k (max cocktail size, typically 3-5)\n  ∀ pᵢ, pⱼ ∈ S: C(pᵢ, pⱼ) > threshold (no conflicts)\n\nSolutions:\n  - Greedy: Add phage with best coverage/compatibility ratio\n  - ILP: Optimal but slower\n  - Genetic algorithm: For large phage libraries\n```\n\n**ILP formulation:**\n```\nVariables:\n  xᵢ ∈ {0,1} = 1 if phage i selected\n  yⱼ ∈ {0,1} = 1 if host j covered\n\nMaximize: Σⱼ yⱼ\nSubject to:\n  Σᵢ xᵢ ≤ k                           (cocktail size limit)\n  yⱼ ≤ Σᵢ R[i,j] × xᵢ                 (coverage constraint)\n  xᵢ + xⱼ ≤ 1 for incompatible pairs  (compatibility constraint)\n```\n\n### Implementation Approach\n\n**Feature extraction for compatibility:**\n```typescript\ninterface PhageInterferenceFeatures {\n  phageId: number;\n  receptorGenes: string[];          // e.g., ['OmpC', 'LamB']\n  sieGenes: string[];               // Superinfection exclusion\n  lysisTime: 'early' | 'middle' | 'late';\n  lifecycle: 'lytic' | 'temperate';\n  immunityRegion?: string;          // For temperate phages\n  hostRange: Set<string>;           // Confirmed hosts\n}\n```\n\n**Pairwise compatibility calculation:**\n```typescript\ninterface CompatibilityScore {\n  phageA: number;\n  phageB: number;\n  score: number;  // -1 to +1\n  factors: { name: string; contribution: number; reason: string }[];\n  compatible: boolean;  // score > threshold\n}\n\n// Compute receptor overlap, Sie presence, lysis timing,\n// immunity cross-reaction, host range complementarity\n```\n\n**Optimal cocktail solver (greedy):**\n```typescript\ninterface CocktailSolution {\n  phages: number[];\n  coverage: string[];  // Hosts covered\n  coveragePercent: number;\n  compatibilityScore: number;  // Average pairwise score\n  rationale: string[];\n}\n\n// While selected.length < maxSize and covered.size < targetHosts.length:\n//   Find best phage (compatible + max marginal coverage)\n//   Add to selection, update covered set\n```\n\n### TUI Visualization\n\n```\nPhage Cocktail Compatibility Matrix\n═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\n\nCompatibility Heatmap (12 phages):\n          │ λ   T4  T7  P22 M13 Mu  Φ29 Φ6  T5  SPβ HK97 P1  │\n──────────┼─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤\nLambda    │ ·   +0.6 +0.4 -0.3 +0.8 +0.2 +0.5 +0.7 +0.1 -0.7 +0.3 +0.4 │\nT4        │     ·    +0.5 +0.6 +0.7 +0.3 +0.4 +0.8 +0.6 +0.4 +0.5 +0.5 │\nT7        │          ·    +0.5 +0.6 +0.4 +0.8 +0.7 +0.3 +0.3 +0.4 +0.5 │\nP22       │               ·    +0.5 -0.2 +0.3 +0.6 +0.4 +0.5 -0.4 +0.3 │\n...       │                                                             │\n──────────┴─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\n\nLegend: ▓▓▓ +0.8 ▒▒▒ +0.4 ░░░ 0.0 ··· -0.4 ▫▫▫ -0.8\n\n⚠ Incompatible pairs:\n  Lambda × SPbeta (-0.7): Cross-immunity (temperate, 78% identity)\n  Lambda × P22 (-0.3): Same receptor (LamB)\n\n───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nCOCKTAIL OPTIMIZER\n\nTarget hosts: E. coli K-12, B, C; Salmonella; P. aeruginosa (5 total)\n\n✓ RECOMMENDED COCKTAIL:\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│  1.

This provides quantitative guidance.\n2. **Resistance prevention**: Cocktails are essential but bad combinations are worse than single phages.\n3. **Scalable optimization**: As phage libraries grow (thousands), manual selection becomes impossible.\n4. **Explainable recommendations**: Not just \"use these\" but \"because X covers Y, and Z adds receptor diversity.\"\n5. **Novel contribution**: No existing tool combines compatibility scoring with coverage optimization.\n\n### Innovation Assessment\n\n**Novelty: VERY HIGH** - First computational compatibility predictor for phages. First cocktail optimization solver. Novel integration of molecular interference mechanisms.\n\n**Pedagogical Value: 9/10** - Teaches Sie, receptor competition, immunity, combinatorial optimization (set cover, ILP, greedy), therapy design principles.\n\n**Wow Factor: 9/10** - Heatmap with green (compatible) and red (incompatible) is immediately intuitive. Watching algorithm select optimal cocktail with rationale feels like having an expert consultant.\n\n### Data Requirements\n- Phage interference features (receptors, Sie genes, lysis timing)\n- Host range data (which phages infect which hosts)\n- Immunity region sequences (for temperate phages)","notes":"## Implementation Complete (BlueMountain)\n\nEnhanced CocktailCompatibilityOverlay.tsx with:\n\n### New Features:\n1.

{"id":"phage_explorer-4yjp","title":"Implement WASM Fuzzy Search","description":"## Overview\n\nImplement high-performance fuzzy search using WebAssembly (WASM) for instant search results across the entire database. Currently, the CommandPalette and SearchOverlay use JavaScript-based search which can lag on large datasets.\n\n## Problem Statement\n\nCurrent search implementation:\n- Uses JavaScript fuzzy matching (fzy-style)\n- Works well for small datasets (12 phages)\n- Will not scale to 1000+ phages or searching within gene annotations\n- No FTS5 integration despite sql.js supporting it\n\n## Technical Requirements\n\n### Option A: Rust WASM Fuzzy Search Module (Recommended)\n\nBuild a Rust crate that compiles to WASM:\n\n```rust\n// In packages/wasm-compute/src/search.rs\nuse wasm_bindgen::prelude::*;\n\n#[wasm_bindgen]\npub struct FuzzySearcher {\n    entries: Vec<SearchEntry>,\n    // Pre-built trigram index for O(1) candidate filtering\n    trigram_index: HashMap<[u8; 3], Vec<usize>>,\n}\n\n#[wasm_bindgen]\nimpl FuzzySearcher {\n    pub fn new() -> Self { ... }\n    pub fn add_entry(&mut self, id: u32, text: &str, category: &str) { ... }\n    pub fn search(&self, query: &str, limit: usize) -> JsValue { ... }\n}\n```\n\n**Algorithm:** Smith-Waterman or fzy scoring with trigram pre-filtering\n\n### Option B: FTS5 via sql.js\n\nUse SQLite's built-in full-text search:\n\n```typescript\n// Create FTS5 virtual table\ndb.run(`CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE search_index USING fts5(\n  phage_name, gene_name, product, description,\n  content='genes'\n)`);\n\n// Search with ranking\ndb.exec(`SELECT * FROM search_index \n  WHERE search_index MATCH ? \n  ORDER BY bm25(search_index) LIMIT 20`, [query]);\n```\n\n**Pros:** No new WASM, uses existing sql.js\n**Cons:** Less flexible scoring, needs FTS5 table setup\n\n### Option C: Hybrid Approach\n\n- Use FTS5 for initial candidate retrieval\n- Apply WASM fuzzy scoring for final ranking\n- Best of both: database-backed + high-quality ranking\n\n## Integration Points\n\n### 1. Search Worker\nCreate/enhance `packages/web/src/workers/search.worker.ts`:\n\n```typescript\nconst searcher = new FuzzySearcher();\n\n// On database load:\nfunction indexDatabase(db: Database) {\n  // Index phage names, gene names, products, descriptions\n  for (const phage of phages) {\n    searcher.add_entry(phage.id, phage.name, 'phage');\n    for (const gene of phage.genes) {\n      searcher.add_entry(gene.id, gene.product, 'gene');\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n// On search:\nfunction search(query: string): SearchResult[] {\n  return searcher.search(query, 50);\n}\n```\n\n### 2. UI Integration\n\n**CommandPalette:**\n```typescript\n// Replace current JS search with worker call\nconst results = await searchWorker.search(query);\n```\n\n**SearchOverlay:**\n```typescript\n// Same pattern\nconst results = await searchWorker.search(query);\n```\n\n### 3. Search Categories\n\nSupport searching across:\n- Phage names\n- Gene names and locus tags\n- Gene products (e.g., \"DNA polymerase\")\n- Annotations and descriptions\n- Commands (existing)\n\n## Performance Targets\n\n| Metric | Target |\n|--------|--------|\n| Index build time | < 100ms for 12 phages |\n| Search latency | < 10ms for 1000 entries |\n| Memory overhead | < 5MB for index |\n\n## Files to Create/Modify\n\n### New Files:\n```\npackages/wasm-compute/src/search.rs    # WASM fuzzy search (if Option A)\npackages/web/src/workers/search.worker.ts  # Search worker enhancement\n```\n\n### Modified Files:\n```\npackages/web/src/components/overlays/CommandPalette.tsx\npackages/web/src/components/overlays/SearchOverlay.tsx\npackages/web/src/db/SqlJsRepository.ts  # Add FTS5 table setup\n```\n\n## Build Integration\n\nIf using Rust WASM:\n1. Add to `packages/wasm-compute/Cargo.toml`\n2. Update `bun run build:wasm` script\n3. Import in worker via wasm-bindgen\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n1. Benchmark: Compare JS vs WASM search times\n2. Quality: Verify fuzzy matching produces sensible results\n3. Scale: Test with synthetic 1000+ entry dataset\n4. Integration: E2E test that CommandPalette returns results\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n- [ ] Search results appear in < 50ms\n- [ ] Fuzzy matching quality comparable to fzy/fzf\n- [ ] Works in CommandPalette and SearchOverlay\n- [ ] Indexes phages, genes, and commands\n- [ ] No main thread blocking during search\n\n## Rationale\n\nFast search is critical for keyboard-first UX. Users expect instant results (< 100ms perceived). As the database grows beyond 12 phages, current JS implementation will become a bottleneck. WASM provides near-native performance while maintaining web compatibility.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-12-17T01:22:44.781274066Z","updated_at":"2025-12-17T23:18:48.544576550Z","closed_at":"2025-12-17T23:18:48.544576550Z","close_reason":"Implemented worker-backed fuzzy search (CommandPalette + SearchOverlay + mobile phage picker); sql.js FTS5 unavailable","compaction_level":0,"original_size":0,"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"phage_explorer-4yjp","depends_on_id":"phage_explorer-9dr4","type":"discovered-from","created_at":"2026-01-26T01:12:18Z","created_by":"import"}]}

Fix GlyphAtlas to render micro-text at small sizes (4-8px)\n2. Implement smart zoom presets with semantic labels\n3. Add dual-row DNA+AA rendering mode\n4.

This makes the sequence grid useless for reading on mobile at moderate zoom levels.\n\n## Solution\nCreate optimized micro-text rendering for 4-8px cell widths using:\n\n1. **Pixel-perfect bitmap fonts**: Pre-render 4x6 and 5x7 pixel bitmap fonts for nucleotides (A,T,G,C,N) and amino acids (20 letters)\n\n2. **Subpixel rendering**: Use LCD subpixel rendering on capable displays for effective 3x resolution horizontally\n\n3. **Contrast optimization**: Use maximum contrast colors (pure white on colored background) for micro-text\n\n4. **Glyph caching**: Pre-render all glyphs to OffscreenCanvas atlas at multiple sizes\n\n## Technical Approach\n\n```typescript\n// In GlyphAtlas.ts\ninterface MicroGlyphConfig {\n  charWidth: 4 | 5 | 6;  // pixels\n  charHeight: 6 | 7 | 8; // pixels\n  subpixelRendering: boolean;\n}\n\n// Bitmap font data for 4x6 nucleotides\nconst MICRO_FONT_4x6: Record<Nucleotide, number[]> = {\n  A: [0b0110, 0b1001, 0b1111, 0b1001, 0b1001, 0b0000],\n  T: [0b1111, 0b0100, 0b0100, 0b0100, 0b0100, 0b0000],\n  G: [0b0111, 0b1000, 0b1011, 0b1001, 0b0111, 0b0000],\n  C: [0b0111, 0b1000, 0b1000, 0b1000, 0b0111, 0b0000],\n  N: [0b1001, 0b1101, 0b1011, 0b1001, 0b1001, 0b0000],\n};\n```\n\n## Files to Modify\n\n- `/packages/web/src/rendering/GlyphAtlas.ts`\n  - Add `renderMicroGlyph(char, cellWidth, cellHeight)` method\n  - Add bitmap font data constants\n  - Add subpixel rendering path\n  - Update `drawNucleotide` and `drawAminoAcid` to use micro glyphs when appropriate\n\n## Testing\n\n1.

WebPhageRepository (Critical)\n\n**What**: Implementation of the `PhageRepository` interface using sql.js\n\n**Why sql.js**: \n- Browser-native SQLite via WebAssembly\n- Single source of truth (same DB as TUI)\n- No backend server required\n- Works offline once cached\n\n**Interface to implement**:\n- `listPhages(): Promise<PhageSummary[]>`\n- `getPhageByIndex(index: number): Promise<PhageFull | null>`\n- `getSequenceWindow(phageId, start, end): Promise<string>`\n- `searchPhages(query: string): Promise<PhageSummary[]>`\n\n### 2. State Integration\n\n**What**: Connect @phage-explorer/state Zustand store to React components\n\n**Current state**: Web has its own `useWebPreferences` store but doesn't use the shared store\n\n**Goal**: Unified state management matching TUI behavior\n\n### 3. App.tsx Rewrite\n\n**What**: Transform from static landing page to full application shell\n\n**Must include**:\n- useDatabase() hook for DB lifecycle\n- Loading states with progress indicator\n- Error boundary for DB failures\n- Proper component layout (PhageList, SequenceGrid, GeneMap)\n- Keyboard manager integration\n- Overlay system wiring\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- **Blocks**: All other phases (nothing works without this)\n- **Depends on**: None (pure foundation work)\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n- [ ] Database loads in browser with progress indicator\n- [ ] PhageRepository methods return correct data\n- [ ] Zustand store updates propagate to components\n- [ ] App.tsx renders proper layout (not landing page)\n- [ ] Keyboard events are captured\n\n## Files to Create/Modify\n\n```\npackages/web/src/\n├── data/\n│   ├── WebPhageRepository.ts    # NEW\n│   └── initDatabase.ts          # NEW\n├── App.tsx                      # REWRITE\n└── main.tsx                     # Minor updates\n```\n\n## Estimated Complexity: Medium\n\nThis phase is well-defined but critical.

By establishing the package structure, build tooling, theme system, and keyboard handling first, all subsequent development follows consistent patterns and shares common infrastructure.\n\n## Deliverables\n1. **Package Scaffold** - `packages/web` with Vite + React 19\n2. **Path Aliases** - Configured imports for `@phage-explorer/*` shared packages\n3. **Layout Shell** - Header, Main content area, Footer components\n4. **Theme System** - Full port of TUI themes with CSS variables\n5. **Keyboard Manager** - Hotkey registration, vim-style modal support\n6. **CSS Foundation** - Reset, typography, base variables\n\n## Technical Decisions\n- **Vite over Next.js**: No SSR needed, Vite is faster and simpler\n- **React 19**: Concurrent features for smooth updates\n- **CSS Modules + Variables**: Scoped styles, zero runtime, theme tokens\n- **No UI library**: Custom primitives for maximum control over cyberpunk aesthetic\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] App boots in browser without errors\n- [ ] Theme switching works (all 10 themes from TUI)\n- [ ] Basic keyboard shortcuts respond (arrow keys, Escape, ?)\n- [ ] Build produces optimized bundle (<200KB initial)\n- [ ] TypeScript compilation passes with strict mode\n- [ ] Shared packages (@core, @state) import correctly\n\n## Risks & Mitigations\n- **Risk**: Path alias resolution issues with Vite\n  - **Mitigation**: Test imports early, configure tsconfig.json properly\n- **Risk**: Theme token explosion\n  - **Mitigation**: Use semantic tokens mapped to theme palettes\n\n## Dependencies\n- Existing `@phage-explorer/core` package\n- Existing `@phage-explorer/state` package\n\n## Implementation Notes\nThe keyboard manager should support vim-style modal patterns (NORMAL, SEARCH, COMMAND, VISUAL modes) from day one. This is fundamental to the keyboard-first design philosophy.\n\nFont loading strategy: Self-host JetBrains Mono with font-display: swap for fast rendering.","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-12-07T21:56:11.524254Z","updated_at":"2025-12-07T22:33:52.685672Z","closed_at":"2025-12-07T22:33:52.685672Z","compaction_level":0,"original_size":0,"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"phage_explorer-87z","depends_on_id":"phage_explorer-sar","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-26T01:12:18Z","created_by":"import"}]}

Swipe gestures (undiscoverable)\n2. Prev/Next buttons in ControlDeck (sequential only)\n\nThere's no way to quickly jump to a specific phage. The phage name in the header looks like static text, not an interactive element.\n\n## Solution: Tappable Header with Dropdown Picker\n\nTransform the phage name in the header into a tappable element that:\n1. Shows a chevron indicating it's interactive\n2. Opens a bottom sheet / dropdown with searchable phage list\n3. Allows quick jump to any phage\n\n## Visual Design\n\n### Header (closed state)\n```\n┌─────────────────────────────────────┐\n│  T4 Phage ▼   [3/42]                │  <- Tappable, shows count\n└─────────────────────────────────────┘\n```\n\n### Picker (open state) - Bottom Sheet on mobile\n```\n┌─────────────────────────────────────┐\n│           SELECT PHAGE              │\n│  ─────────────────────────          │ <- Drag handle\n│  🔍 Search phages...                │\n│  ───────────────────────────────    │\n│  ○ Lambda phage                     │\n│  ○ T4 Phage                         │\n│  ● T7 Phage  ← current (highlighted)│\n│  ○ Phi X174                         │\n│  ○ MS2                              │\n│  ...                                │\n└─────────────────────────────────────┘\n```\n\n## Implementation Plan\n\n### 1. Create PhagePickerTrigger component\n\n```tsx\n// packages/web/src/components/mobile/PhagePickerTrigger.tsx\ninterface PhagePickerTriggerProps {\n  phageName: string;\n  currentIndex: number;\n  totalCount: number;\n  onClick: () => void;\n}\n\n// Renders: \"T4 Phage ▼  3/42\"\n```\n\n### 2. Create PhagePickerSheet (bottom sheet)\n\n```tsx\n// packages/web/src/components/mobile/PhagePickerSheet.tsx\n- Uses BottomSheet component (exists at components/mobile/BottomSheet.tsx)\n- Search input for filtering\n- List of phages with current highlighted\n- Tap to select and close\n```\n\n### 3. Integrate into AppShell header\n\n```tsx\n// In header prop of AppShell\nheader={{\n  title: isMobile ? (\n    <PhagePickerTrigger\n      phageName={currentPhage?.name ?? 'Select Phage'}\n      currentIndex={currentPhageIndex}\n      totalCount={phages.length}\n      onClick={() => setPhagePickerOpen(true)}\n    />\n  ) : currentPhage?.name,\n  // ...\n}}\n```\n\n### 4. Style the trigger for discoverability\n\n```css\n.phage-picker-trigger {\n  display: inline-flex;\n  align-items: center;\n  gap: 0.25rem;\n  padding: 0.25rem 0.5rem;\n  border-radius: var(--radius-md);\n  background: var(--color-background-hover);\n  cursor: pointer;\n  transition: background var(--duration-fast);\n}\n.phage-picker-trigger:active {\n  background: var(--color-background-active);\n}\n```\n\n## Design Decisions\n\n### Why Bottom Sheet (not dropdown)?\n- **Thumb reach**: Bottom sheets are easier to reach on phones\n- **More space**: Can show more phages with search\n- **Native feel**: iOS/Android users expect bottom sheets for pickers\n- **Existing infrastructure**: BottomSheet component already exists\n\n### Counter Badge (3/42)\n- Shows position in the list at a glance\n- Helps user understand there are many phages\n- Compact enough for mobile header\n\n## Files to Create/Modify\n\n- CREATE: `packages/web/src/components/mobile/PhagePickerTrigger.tsx`\n- CREATE: `packages/web/src/components/mobile/PhagePickerSheet.tsx`\n- CREATE: `packages/web/src/styles/phage-picker.css`\n- MODIFY: `packages/web/src/App.tsx` (state + integration)\n- MODIFY: `packages/web/src/components/layout/AppShell.tsx` (accept ReactNode for title)\n- MODIFY: `packages/web/src/components/mobile/index.ts` (exports)\n\n## Accessibility\n\n- Trigger: role=\"button\", aria-haspopup=\"listbox\", aria-expanded\n- Sheet: role=\"listbox\", aria-label=\"Select phage\"\n- Items: role=\"option\", aria-selected for current\n- Focus trap within sheet when open\n- Escape closes sheet\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- Phage name in header is visually interactive (background, chevron)\n- Tapping opens bottom sheet with all phages\n- Current phage is highlighted/selected in list\n- Search input filters phage list\n- Tapping phage closes sheet and navigates\n- Position badge shows \"X/Y\" format\n- Sheet is keyboard navigable and screen-reader friendly","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-16T17:36:49.790666330Z","updated_at":"2025-12-16T17:54:35.713411044Z","closed_at":"2025-12-16T17:54:35.713411044Z","close_reason":"Implemented PhagePickerTrigger and PhagePickerSheet components with search, current selection highlighting, and BottomSheet integration.

{"id":"phage_explorer-de4o","title":"Fix 3D viewer zoom-to-extents auto-fit","notes":"# Fix 3D Viewer Zoom-to-Extents (Auto-Fit)\n\n## Problem Statement\n\nThis is the **THIRD TIME** this has been requested. The 3D viewer does not properly auto-fit molecules to the viewport.\n\n**What should happen:** When a 3D structure loads, the camera should automatically position itself so the entire molecule is visible with a small margin (~10% padding).\n\n**What currently happens:** The camera distance calculation exists but doesn't produce the correct result. Molecules either appear too small or too large, requiring manual zoom.\n\n## Technical Background\n\n\"Zoom to extents\" (also called \"fit to screen\" or \"auto-fit\") is a standard feature in all professional 3D viewers:\n- PyMOL: `zoom` command\n- ChimeraX: `view` command\n- VMD: \"Reset View\" button\n- Blender: Numpad . (period)\n\nThe algorithm:\n1. Compute bounding box/sphere of the molecule\n2. Calculate optimal camera distance: `dist = radius / tan(FOV/2)`\n3. Add padding factor (typically 1.1-1.2)\n4. Position camera at that distance, looking at center\n\n## Current Code Analysis\n\n**File:** `/packages/web/src/components/Model3DView.tsx`\n**Lines:** 376-394\n\n```tsx\n// ZOOM TO EXTENTS: Calculate optimal camera distance\nconst fovRad = (camera.fov * Math.PI) / 180;\nconst optimalDist = (structureData.radius / Math.tan(fovRad / 2)) * 1.2;\nconst dist = Math.max(optimalDist, structureData.radius * 1.5);\n\ncamera.position.set(\n  dist * 0.7,  // ← PROBLEM: These factors reduce the actual distance\n  dist * 0.5,\n  dist * 0.7\n);\n```\n\nThe issue is in the camera positioning. While `dist` is calculated correctly, the position is set at `(0.7, 0.5, 0.7)` of that distance, which is closer than intended.\n\n## Solution\n\n1. Calculate the actual distance needed for the angled view:\n   ```tsx\n   const actualDist = dist / Math.sqrt(0.7*0.7 + 0.5*0.5 + 0.7*0.7);\n   ```\n\n2. Or use the correct magnitude:\n   ```tsx\n   const angle = new Vector3(1, 0.7, 1).normalize();\n   camera.position.copy(angle.multiplyScalar(dist));\n   ```\n\n3. Consider aspect ratio in the calculation:\n   ```tsx\n   const aspect = camera.aspect;\n   const vFov = fovRad;\n   const hFov = 2 * Math.atan(Math.tan(vFov/2) * aspect);\n   const fovToUse = Math.min(vFov, hFov);  // Use tighter FOV\n   ```\n\n## Testing Checklist\n\n- [ ] Load phiX174 (small, ~5k atoms) - should fill ~80-90% of viewport\n- [ ] Load T4 (large, ~170k atoms) - should fill ~80-90% of viewport\n- [ ] Load Lambda (medium) - should fill ~80-90% of viewport\n- [ ] Resize window - molecule should refit appropriately\n- [ ] Different render modes should all auto-fit correctly\n\n## Definition of Done\n\n- [ ] All molecules auto-fit to viewport with 10% margin\n- [ ] Works across all render modes (Ball-Stick, Ribbon, Surface)\n- [ ] Works on initial load AND when switching phages\n- [ ] No manual zoom required to see entire structure","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-09T16:25:47.477472Z","updated_at":"2025-12-09T16:39:59.161240Z","closed_at":"2025-12-09T16:39:59.161240Z","compaction_level":0,"original_size":0,"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"phage_explorer-de4o","depends_on_id":"phage_explorer-vru3","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-26T01:12:18Z","created_by":"import"}]}

{"id":"phage_explorer-dy7l","title":"EPIC: Rust/WASM Acceleration Phase 2 (hot loops + zero-copy)","description":"# Overview\nPhage Explorer already uses Rust/WASM in a few critical places (sql.js for SQLite, wasm-compute for some analytics, and WASM spatial-hash bond detection for 3D structures). This epic plans the **next wave** of Rust/WASM work to reduce latency, jank, and \"waiting\" across the web app and workers.\n\n## Why this epic exists\nWe are now hitting the natural limits of \"optimize the JS\" approaches in a few hot paths:\n- High-volume k-mer pipelines (counting, sketching, similarity) still pay JS overhead (string slicing, Map/Set churn).\n- Some analyses (dotplots, diffs, PCA) can become noticeably slow on mid-range laptops and older mobile devices.\n- Worker isolation prevents UI freezes, but it does **not** make the computation itself fast; it can still feel like \"stuck at 20%\".\n\nRust/WASM is our lever to:\n- Make heavy loops tighter (fewer allocations, better cache locality)\n- Use typed-array APIs that avoid JS object churn\n- Enable optional zero-copy paths (SharedArrayBuffer) when COOP/COEP is available\n\n## Global constraints / principles\n- **Modern browsers stay fastest.** New WASM paths must not regress latest Chrome/Safari/Firefox.\n- **Old browsers still work.** Every new WASM path must have a safe fallback (JS or a simpler kernel).\n- **Keep WASM small & modular.** Avoid pulling huge crates into the always-loaded module. Prefer worker-local dynamic imports for optional features.\n- **Design the boundary first.** WASM wins disappear if we bounce giant strings/JSON across the boundary every call.\n\n## Success metrics (user-facing)\n- Overlay open-to-first-render time is consistently low (no long \"busy\" hangs).\n- Heavy overlays feel interactive quickly via progressive refinement (coarse-first).\n- Minimal main-thread stalls and fewer large GC pauses.\n\n## Implementation strategy (high level)\n1. Build a reusable data plane: byte-based sequence transfer + stable WASM loader patterns.\n2. Ship high-impact kernels first: k-mer counting/sketching, dotplot, diff.\n3. Only then migrate secondary analytics (PCA and other worker primitives).\n\n## Non-goals\n- Rewriting the whole app into WASM.\n- Large monolithic WASM bundles that slow down initial load.\n- Removing existing JS implementations unless the WASM version is proven superior and we keep an emergency fallback.","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-12-31T02:33:49.580172918Z","updated_at":"2026-01-05T20:13:21.712003354Z","closed_at":"2026-01-05T20:13:21.712003354Z","close_reason":"Closed","compaction_level":0,"original_size":0,"labels":["perf","roadmap","wasm","web"]}

Without this layer, the app is just a viewer, not an explorer.\n\n## Design Principles\n1. **Every action has a hotkey** - No mouse-required features\n2. **Fuzzy search everywhere** - Command palette, search, menus\n3. **Modal consistency** - All panels behave the same way\n4. **Layer stacking** - Multiple overlays can be active\n\n## Deliverables\n1. **Command Palette** - Fuzzy search, keyboard navigation, `:` trigger\n2. **Analysis Menu** - Drawer with all analysis options\n3. **Simulation Hub** - Modal launcher for simulations\n4. **Layer 1 Overlays** - GC, complexity, bendability, promoter, repeat\n5. **Multi-Overlay Manager** - Stack management, z-index, focus trap\n6. **Help Overlay** - Dynamic hotkey reference\n\n## Component Architecture\n\n### Command Palette\n```\nFeatures:\n- Fuzzy search with highlighting\n- Category grouping (theme:, overlay:, sim:, export:)\n- Recent commands\n- Keyboard navigation (↑↓, Enter, Tab complete)\n- Cyberpunk styling (glow, scanlines)\n```\n\n### Overlay Stack Manager\n```typescript\nclass OverlayStackManager {\n  push(overlay): void      // Add overlay to stack\n  pop(id?): void           // Remove overlay\n  toggle(overlay): void    // Toggle overlay visibility\n  getTopmost(): Overlay    // For focus management\n  hasBlockingModal(): bool // Prevent background interaction\n}\n```\n\n### Panel System\n```\nPositions: left, right, bottom, center\nSizes: sm, md, lg, xl, full\nFeatures:\n- Focus trapping\n- Escape to close\n- Spring animations\n- Scanline overlay decoration\n```\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] All hotkeys from TUI work in web app\n- [ ] Command palette with fuzzy search\n- [ ] Overlays toggle correctly with hotkeys\n- [ ] Multiple overlays can stack visually\n- [ ] Panel animations are smooth (60fps)\n- [ ] Help overlay shows all current hotkeys\n- [ ] Focus trap works for modals\n\n## Hotkey Parity Checklist\n```\nNavigation: ↑↓←→, hjkl, gg, G, Ctrl+g\nView: Space, 1/2/3, f, t, T, d, m, M, z\nOverlays: g, x, b, p, r, J, L, V, Y, 0\nPanels: a/A, S, :, w/W, /, s, ?, Ctrl+p\n```\n\n## Risks & Mitigations\n- **Risk**: Fuzzy search performance with many commands\n  - **Mitigation**: Use efficient algorithm (fzy/fzf-style)\n- **Risk**: Focus management complexity\n  - **Mitigation**: Use React focus trap library, test thoroughly\n- **Risk**: Animation performance\n  - **Mitigation**: Use CSS transforms, avoid layout thrashing\n\n## Dependencies\n- Phase 0 (keyboard manager)\n- Phase 2 (core visualization to overlay on)","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-12-07T21:56:15.528715Z","updated_at":"2025-12-08T02:09:35.227829Z","closed_at":"2025-12-08T02:09:35.227829Z","compaction_level":0,"original_size":0,"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"phage_explorer-ee1","depends_on_id":"phage_explorer-10p","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-26T01:12:18Z","created_by":"import"},{"issue_id":"phage_explorer-ee1","depends_on_id":"phage_explorer-87z","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-26T01:12:18Z","created_by":"import"}]}

The Ribbon view works correctly because it uses explicit color assignment.\n\n## Root Cause Analysis\n\nThe issue is in `packages/web/src/visualization/structure-loader.ts`. The materials for InstancedMesh use:\n```typescript\nconst atomMat = new MeshPhongMaterial({\n  color: 0xffffff,\n  vertexColors: true,  // <-- THIS IS THE BUG\n  ...\n});\n```\n\n**The Bug**: `vertexColors: true` tells Three.js to look for per-vertex color attributes in the geometry. But InstancedMesh uses INSTANCE colors (via `setColorAt()`), not vertex colors. These are different systems:\n- `vertexColors: true` → expects BufferGeometry with 'color' attribute\n- InstancedMesh colors → uses `instanceColor` buffer created by `setColorAt()`\n\nWhen `vertexColors: true` is set but no vertex colors exist, the material renders as black because it multiplies the base color by non-existent vertex colors (defaulting to black).\n\n## Solution\n\nRemove `vertexColors: true` from all InstancedMesh materials in structure-loader.ts:\n\n1. **buildBallAndStick()** - atomMat (line ~477)\n2. **buildSurfaceImpostor()** - outerMat (line ~594), innerMat (line ~616)\n3. **buildFunctionalGroupHighlights()** - halo mat (line ~717)\n\nThe base `color: 0xffffff` will be multiplied by the instance colors set via `setColorAt()`.\n\n## Files to Modify\n- `packages/web/src/visualization/structure-loader.ts`\n\n## Verification\n1. Load any phage with PDB structure\n2. Switch to Ball-and-Stick mode\n3. Verify Carbon atoms appear gray, Nitrogen blue, Oxygen red, etc.\n4. Switch to Surface mode - verify same coloring\n5. Toggle functional group highlights - verify they show correctly\n\n## Element Color Reference (from ELEMENT_COLORS):\n- H: #f8fafc (white)\n- C: #64748b (slate gray)\n- N: #3b82f6 (bright blue)\n- O: #ef4444 (bright red)\n- S: #fde047 (bright yellow)\n- P: #fb923c (orange)","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-12-15T19:58:12.441537476Z","updated_at":"2025-12-15T20:41:20.180916137Z","closed_at":"2025-12-15T20:41:20.180916137Z","compaction_level":0,"original_size":0,"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"phage_explorer-eg2f","depends_on_id":"phage_explorer-bmmb","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-26T01:12:18Z","created_by":"import"}]}

{"id":"phage_explorer-f9go","title":"Bug: SharedSequencePool refCount leak breaks eviction/latency","description":"# Problem\n`SharedSequencePool` currently increments `refCount` when `getOrCreateRef()` is called for an *existing* entry. Several callers (DotPlotOverlay / ComparisonOverlay / ComputeOrchestrator) call `getOrCreateRef()` repeatedly and do not reliably `release()` the ref.\n\nThis breaks the intended lease semantics and causes:\n- `refCount` to grow unbounded over time\n- eviction heuristics to degrade (entries appear permanently referenced)\n- higher memory use and worse latency/jank in overlays that depend on workers\n\n# Why this matters\nEven with workers/WASM, performance is dominated by memory pressure + data-plane overhead. If sequences never evict (or refcounts become meaningless) we pay:\n- more resident memory (SAB/AB + caches)\n- more GC pressure\n- worse responsiveness when opening overlays (dotplot/comparison)\n\n# Root cause hypothesis\n`getOrCreateRef()` is used as a convenient \"give me a SequenceBytesRef\" helper, but it is treated as an idempotent accessor at call sites. Internally it increments `refCount` each time, which only makes sense if every call is paired with a decrement (lease release). That pairing is missing in current call sites.\n\n# Fix strategy (preferred)\nMake `refCount` represent *explicit pin leases* only. Accessors that simply return an existing ref must not increment. Provide a clear API for pin/unpin to avoid accidental leaks.\n\n# Compatibility\n- Keep existing functionality (SAB when crossOriginIsolated, transferable AB fallback).\n- Maintain broad browser support; do not assume SAB everywhere.\n\n# Acceptance criteria\n- Pool refcount does not grow without bound during repeated overlay open/close cycles.\n- Entries can evict deterministically when not pinned.\n- DotPlot/Comparison still work (no detached buffer regressions).\n- Add minimal invariants (dev-only) to detect refcount underflow/leaks.","acceptance_criteria":"- Fix refCount semantics (no unbounded growth)\n- Add/adjust call sites so leases are balanced\n- `bun run build:web` succeeds\n- `ubs` on changed files exits 0","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-12-31T07:25:41.338708987Z","updated_at":"2025-12-31T07:33:10.721351489Z","closed_at":"2025-12-31T07:33:10.721351489Z","close_reason":"Fixed refCount semantics; pool access no longer increments pin count; added explicit pin() and dev underflow warning; verified build:web + ubs diff","compaction_level":0,"original_size":0,"labels":["perf","web","worker"],"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"phage_explorer-f9go","depends_on_id":"phage_explorer-8qk2.3.2","type":"discovered-from","created_at":"2026-01-26T01:12:18Z","created_by":"import"}]}

Features Braille-character TUI rendering (8x resolution), interactive zoom into k-mer space, side-by-side comparison, and reveals CpG suppression, codon bias, and horizontal gene transfer signatures. Novelty: 9/10, Pedagogical: 9/10, Cool Factor: 10/10.","notes":"## CHAOS GAME REPRESENTATION (CGR) FRACTAL FINGERPRINTS\n\n**Comprehensive Feature Specification from Roadmap**\n\n### Concept\nThe Chaos Game Representation transforms a linear DNA sequence into a 2D fractal image encoding the complete k-mer frequency spectrum in a single visual fingerprint. Based on H. Joel Jeffrey's 1990 algorithm using an Iterated Function System (IFS):\n\n**Algorithm**: Assign nucleotides to unit square corners (A=top-left, T=top-right, G=bottom-right, C=bottom-left). Start at center. For each nucleotide, move halfway toward its corner and place a point. After k steps, point location uniquely encodes the last k nucleotides.\n\n**Biological Insights Revealed**:\n- CpG suppression (void in CG corner region - methylation signature)\n- Codon bias (highly expressed genes cluster in preferred codon regions)\n- Repetitive elements (unusually bright spots = high local k-mer frequency)\n- Horizontal gene transfer (texture discontinuities = mosaic ancestry)\n- Strand asymmetry (leading vs lagging strand preferences)\n\n### Mathematical Foundations\n\n**CGR Iteration Map**:\nGiven corners: A=(0,0), T=(1,0), C=(0,1), G=(1,1)\nStarting: P0 = (0.5, 0.5)\nFor each nucleotide ni: Pi = (Pi-1 + corner(ni)) / 2\n\n**K-mer to Coordinate Mapping (Bijective)**:\nx = sum(i=1 to k) xi / 2^i   (xi = corner_x(si))\ny = sum(i=1 to k) yi / 2^i   (yi = corner_y(si))\nEvery point in [0,1]^2 corresponds to a unique infinite k-mer.\n\n**Frequency CGR (FCGR)**:\nDiscretize unit square into 2^k x 2^k grid. Each cell counts k-mer occurrences:\n- k=3: 8x8 = 64 cells (trinucleotides)\n- k=4: 16x16 = 256 cells (tetranucleotides)\n\n**Fractal Dimension**: D2 = lim(e->0) log(C(e)) / log(e)\n- Random: D2 ~ 2 (fills plane)\n- Repetitive: D2 < 2 (attractors)\n\n**Comparison Metrics**: Euclidean, Pearson correlation, KL divergence, Cosine similarity\n\n### Implementation\n\n**Core Interfaces**: CGRConfig (resolution, normalize, logScale, smoothing), CGRResult (grid: Float32Array, resolution, maxCount, totalPoints, emptyFraction, entropy)\n\n**computeCGR()**: O(n) iteration, corner lookup, grid increment, entropy calculation\n\n**compareCGR()**: Euclidean distance, Pearson correlation, cosine similarity\n\n**Braille TUI Rendering**: Unicode Braille (0x2800 base) for 8x resolution boost. Heat map coloring.\n\n**Interactive**: Zoom k-mer space, Pan, K-mer lookup, Side-by-side comparison\n\n### Assessment\n- Novelty: 9/10 - CGR + TUI + Braille + interactive zoom unprecedented\n- Pedagogical: 9/10 - IFS, bijective mappings, information theory, chaos\n- Cool Factor: 10/10 - Beautiful fractals from DNA\n\n### Files\n- packages/tui/src/components/CGRView.tsx\n- packages/core/src/analysis/cgr.ts\n- packages/core/src/analysis/cgr-compare.ts","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-12-07T04:14:47.023731Z","updated_at":"2025-12-08T05:31:21.341205Z","closed_at":"2025-12-08T05:31:21.341205Z","compaction_level":0,"original_size":0,"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"phage_explorer-fno","depends_on_id":"phage_explorer-54g","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-26T01:12:18Z","created_by":"import"}]}

Understanding this mosaic structure:\n\n1. **Reveals evolutionary history**: Which phages contributed to this genome?\n2. **Identifies functional modules**: Different regions may encode distinct functions\n3. **Detects recent recombination**: Breakpoints suggest recent HGT events\n4. **Guides cocktail design**: Mosaic phages may have novel host range combinations\n\n## Technical Requirements\n\n### 1. Core Algorithm\nUse existing `computeMosaicRadar()` from `@phage-explorer/core`:\n\n```typescript\nimport { computeMosaicRadar, type ReferenceSketch, type MosaicResult } from '@phage-explorer/core';\n\ninterface ReferenceSketch {\n  label: string;\n  sequence: string;\n}\n\ninterface MosaicResult {\n  windows: Array<{\n    start: number;\n    end: number;\n    similarities: Map<string, number>;  // reference -> jaccard similarity\n  }>;\n  segments: Array<{\n    start: number;\n    end: number;\n    donor: string | null;\n    meanScore: number;\n  }>;\n  breakpoints: number[];  // positions where donor changes\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Parameters (User-Adjustable)\n- `k`: k-mer size (default 5, range 3-8)\n- `windowSize`: bp per window (default 2000, range 500-10000)\n- `minSimilarity`: threshold for donor assignment (default 0.05, range 0.01-0.95)\n- `showBreakpoints`: toggle breakpoint markers\n\n### 3.

Users see a loading spinner for extended periods, especially on:\n- First load (cold cache)\n- Large structures (>10k atoms)\n- Slow network connections\n\n## Current State Analysis\n\nThe loading pipeline:\n1. User selects phage with PDB ID\n2. Fetch structure from RCSB (network latency)\n3. Parse PDB/mmCIF in worker (CPU time)\n4. Build Three.js geometry (CPU time)\n5. Upload to GPU and render\n\nCurrent optimizations already in place:\n- Worker pool for parsing (max 2 workers)\n- TanStack Query for caching fetched structures\n- Auto-quality adjustment based on FPS\n\n## Proposed Optimizations\n\n### 1. Aggressive Structure Pre-fetching\nPre-fetch structures for adjacent phages in the list:\n- When user views phage N, prefetch N-1 and N+1\n- Use idle callback to avoid blocking\n- Cache parsed structures in memory\n\n### 2. Progressive Loading\nShow structure progressively:\n1. Immediately show bounding box/placeholder\n2. Load backbone ribbon first (small, fast)\n3. Then load full ball-and-stick if requested\n\n### 3. Compressed Structure Cache\nStore compressed structures in IndexedDB:\n- Compress parsed atom data with pako/fflate\n- Cache for 7 days\n- ~80% size reduction\n\n### 4. Optimized Geometry Generation\n- Use BufferGeometry with indexed vertices\n- Share geometries between similar structures\n- Lazy-build Surface mode (don't build until requested)\n\n### 5. Loading UX Improvements\n- Show skeleton that approximates final shape\n- Display progress percentage accurately\n- Add \"Loading backbone...\" → \"Loading atoms...\" messages\n\n## Files to Modify\n- packages/web/src/visualization/structure-loader.ts\n- packages/web/src/hooks/useStructureQuery.ts\n- packages/web/src/components/Model3DView.tsx\n- New: packages/web/src/cache/structureCache.ts\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] First load of common structures <2s on fast connection\n- [ ] Repeat load of cached structures <500ms\n- [ ] Adjacent structures prefetched in background\n- [ ] Progress indicator shows meaningful stages\n- [ ] No perceived lag when switching render modes","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-12-15T20:00:24.467494965Z","updated_at":"2025-12-15T20:41:38.885566078Z","closed_at":"2025-12-15T20:41:38.885566078Z","compaction_level":0,"original_size":0,"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"phage_explorer-gbyo","depends_on_id":"phage_explorer-bmmb","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-26T01:12:18Z","created_by":"import"}]}

Issues:\n- Momentum decay is too linear\n- Edge bounce effect missing\n- Scroll snapping to positions would help for codon alignment\n\n## Solution\nImprove VirtualScroller touch handling to feel native:\n\n### Momentum Physics\n```typescript\n// Natural feeling momentum using exponential decay\nprivate applyMomentum() {\n  const FRICTION = 0.95;  // Higher = longer coast\n  const MIN_VELOCITY = 0.5;  // Stop threshold\n  \n  const decay = () => {\n    this.velocity *= FRICTION;\n    this.scrollPosition += this.velocity;\n    \n    // Clamp to bounds with rubber-band effect\n    if (this.scrollPosition < 0) {\n      this.scrollPosition *= 0.5;  // Rubber band\n      this.velocity *= -0.3;  // Bounce back\n    }\n    \n    if (Math.abs(this.velocity) > MIN_VELOCITY) {\n      requestAnimationFrame(decay);\n    } else {\n      this.snapToNearestCodon();  // Optional snapping\n    }\n  };\n  \n  requestAnimationFrame(decay);\n}\n```\n\n### Codon Snapping (Optional)\nAfter scroll ends, optionally snap to nearest codon boundary:\n```typescript\nprivate snapToNearestCodon() {\n  if (!this.snapEnabled) return;\n  const codonSize = this.cellWidth * 3;\n  const nearestCodon = Math.round(this.scrollPosition / codonSize) * codonSize;\n  this.animateTo(nearestCodon, 150);  // 150ms snap animation\n}\n```\n\n### Overscroll Effect\nAdd iOS-style overscroll at boundaries:\n- Allow scrolling 50px past boundaries\n- Spring back with elastic animation\n- Subtle visual cue (glow or color shift)\n\n## Parameters to Tune\n\n| Parameter | Current | Proposed | Effect |\n|-----------|---------|----------|--------|\n| friction | 0.92 | 0.95 | Longer coast |\n| rubberBand | none | 0.5 | Edge elasticity |\n| snapEnabled | false | optional | Codon alignment |\n| minVelocity | 1.0 | 0.5 | Smoother stop |\n\n## Files to Modify\n\n- `/packages/web/src/rendering/VirtualScroller.ts` - Core momentum physics\n- `/packages/web/src/hooks/useSequenceGrid.ts` - Expose snap preference\n- `/packages/web/src/components/SequenceView.tsx` - Add snap toggle to settings\n\n## Testing\n\n1. Compare side-by-side with native iOS scroll\n2. Test on various devices (touch sensitivity differs)\n3. Performance test: ensure 60fps during momentum\n4. Test with accessibility settings (reduced motion)\n","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-09T05:35:15.962673Z","updated_at":"2026-01-08T22:45:51.998897Z","closed_at":"2025-12-16T20:12:15.954111122Z","compaction_level":0,"original_size":0,"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"phage_explorer-idhh","depends_on_id":"phage_explorer-5ozb","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-26T01:12:18Z","created_by":"import"}]}

{"id":"phage_explorer-l5vo","title":"Remove SQLite/Zustand loading message from UI","notes":"# Remove SQLite/Zustand Loading Message\n\n## Problem Statement\n\nThe web app currently displays: \"SQLite loaded via sql.js. Data flows into the shared Zustand store.\"\n\nThis is a **severe UX anti-pattern** for several reasons:\n1. End users don't know what SQLite, sql.js, or Zustand are\n2. It wastes valuable screen real estate\n3. It makes the app look unprofessional/unfinished\n4. It provides zero actionable information to users\n\n## Location\n\n**File:** `/packages/web/src/App.tsx`\n**Lines:** 258-265\n\n```tsx\n{repository && !error ? (\n  <div className=\"db-status-bar\" aria-label=\"Database status\">\n    <span className=\"db-status-icon\">✓</span>\n    <span className=\"db-status-text\">\n      SQLite loaded via sql.js. Data flows into the shared Zustand store.\n    </span>\n    {isCached && <span className=\"badge badge-small\">Cached</span>}\n  </div>\n) : (\n```\n\n## Solution\n\nRemove the entire `db-status-bar` div when the database is successfully loaded. The status should be implicit - if the app is working, the database is loaded.\n\n**Option A (Minimal):** Simply remove lines 258-265\n**Option B (Better UX):** Replace with a subtle loading indicator that disappears once data loads\n\n## Implementation Notes\n\n- The `isCached` badge is useful during development but meaningless to end users\n- Keep the error state display (lines 267-285) for actual error handling\n- Consider moving database status to a developer tools panel (e.g., accessible via Shift+D)\n\n## Testing\n\n1. Load the web app\n2. Verify no \"SQLite loaded\" message appears\n3. Verify error states still display correctly\n4. Verify functionality is unaffected\n\n## Definition of Done\n\n- [ ] No developer-facing messages visible in production UI\n- [ ] Error states still display when database fails to load\n- [ ] Page layout unchanged (no gaps where message was)","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-09T16:25:20.945827Z","updated_at":"2025-12-09T16:38:14.724697Z","closed_at":"2025-12-09T16:38:14.724697Z","compaction_level":0,"original_size":0,"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"phage_explorer-l5vo","depends_on_id":"phage_explorer-jjq5","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-26T01:12:18Z","created_by":"import"}]}

{"id":"phage_explorer-mkpk","title":"Phase 6: 3D Visualization","description":"## Overview\n\nImplement WebGL-based 3D protein structure visualization to replace the TUI's ASCII 3D rendering.\n\n## Why 3D Matters\n\nThe TUI has an ASCII 3D model viewer that renders protein structures using characters. This is impressive for terminal art but limited in:\n- Resolution and detail\n- Smooth rotation/zoom\n- Surface rendering modes\n- Lighting and depth perception\n\nWebGL enables true 3D visualization with:\n- Smooth rotation via mouse/touch\n- Multiple rendering modes (ribbon, surface, ball-and-stick)\n- Real-time lighting\n- High-resolution detail\n\n## Technical Components\n\n### 1. WebGL Model Viewer\n\n**Technology options**:\n- **Three.js** - Full-featured 3D library, large but capable\n- **BabylonJS** - Alternative, similar capabilities\n- **Raw WebGL** - Smallest bundle, most control, most work\n\n**Recommendation**: Three.js with tree-shaking for reasonable bundle size\n\n**Features**:\n- Load PDB/mmCIF structure files\n- Multiple render modes:\n  - Ribbon (secondary structure)\n  - Surface (solvent-accessible)\n  - Ball-and-stick (atomic detail)\n  - Cartoon (simplified)\n- Color schemes:\n  - By element\n  - By residue type\n  - By chain\n  - By B-factor\n  - Custom gradients\n- Controls:\n  - Orbit (rotate around center)\n  - Pan (translate view)\n  - Zoom (scroll wheel)\n  - Reset (return to default view)\n\n### 2. Fullscreen Mode\n\n**What**: Dedicated fullscreen view for detailed structure exploration\n\n**Features**:\n- Full viewport rendering\n- Keyboard controls (arrow keys for rotation)\n- Quality presets (low/medium/high/ultra)\n- Screenshot export\n- Animation support (morph between conformations)\n\n### 3. Structure Data Integration\n\n**Sources**:\n- PDB files bundled with database\n- Fetch from RCSB PDB API\n- AlphaFold predictions\n- Local structure predictions\n\n**Caching**: Cache fetched structures in IndexedDB\n\n## Performance Considerations\n\n3D rendering is GPU-intensive:\n- Use instanced rendering for large structures\n- LOD (Level of Detail) for distant views\n- Throttle updates during rotation\n- Quality presets for different devices\n\n**Quality Presets**:\n| Preset | Target | Settings |\n|--------|--------|----------|\n| Low | Mobile, old laptops | Low poly, no shadows |\n| Medium | Average laptops | Medium detail, basic lighting |\n| High | Desktop | Full detail, shadows |\n| Ultra | Gaming PCs | Max detail, SSAO, anti-aliasing |\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- **Depends on**: Phase 1 (database for structure references)\n- **Blocks**: None (nice-to-have feature)\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n- [ ] 3D model loads and renders\n- [ ] Can rotate/zoom/pan with mouse\n- [ ] Multiple rendering modes available\n- [ ] Fullscreen mode works\n- [ ] Keyboard navigation in fullscreen\n- [ ] Performance meets 30fps minimum\n\n## Files to Create\n\n```\npackages/web/src/\n├── components/\n│   └── Model3DView.tsx              # NEW\n├── visualization/\n│   └── structure/\n│       ├── StructureRenderer.ts     # NEW (Three.js wrapper)\n│       ├── structureLoader.ts       # NEW (PDB/mmCIF parsing)\n│       └── renderModes.ts           # NEW (ribbon, surface, etc.)\n```\n\n## Estimated Complexity: High\n\n3D graphics programming is specialized.

This phase bridges the gap between our SQLite-based TUI and the browser environment.\n\n## Why This Matters\nThe phage database is the core data asset. Without efficient browser access to this data, the web app cannot function. Offline support means researchers can use the app in field conditions, on planes, or anywhere without connectivity.\n\n## Strategic Approach\nWe use **sql.js** (SQLite compiled to WebAssembly) rather than a backend API because:\n1. No server infrastructure to maintain\n2. Works offline after initial load\n3. Same database file as TUI (consistency)\n4. Near-native query performance via WASM\n\n## Deliverables\n1. **sql.js Integration** - Browser adapter in `db-runtime` package\n2. **Database Build Pipeline** - Compression, optimization, manifest\n3. **IndexedDB Caching** - Store database locally for fast reload\n4. **Service Worker** - Workbox-based offline support\n5. **State Persistence** - Browser-safe Zustand hydration\n\n## Technical Details\n\n### Database Pipeline\n```\nphage.db (source) → Optimize → Brotli compress → Chunk → manifest.json\n```\n- Target compressed size: ~10-15MB (from ~50MB)\n- Brotli quality 11 for maximum compression\n\n### Caching Strategy\n1. First visit: Fetch compressed DB from CDN\n2. Decompress and initialize sql.js\n3. Cache raw DB in IndexedDB (faster than re-decompress)\n4. Subsequent visits: Load from IndexedDB\n5. Background check for updates\n\n### Service Worker Strategy\n- **App Shell**: Precached at build time\n- **Database**: StaleWhileRevalidate (use cached, update in background)\n- **WASM modules**: CacheFirst (immutable)\n- **Fonts**: CacheFirst with long TTL\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Database loads and queries work (same results as TUI)\n- [ ] Second visit uses cached database (measurable speedup)\n- [ ] Offline mode fully functional\n- [ ] State persists across sessions\n- [ ] Database update mechanism works\n- [ ] Cold start with cached DB: <1s\n\n## Risks & Mitigations\n- **Risk**: sql.js performance for large queries\n  - **Mitigation**: Precompute heavy queries, use prepared statements\n- **Risk**: IndexedDB storage limits\n  - **Mitigation**: Check quota, handle gracefully, compress if needed\n- **Risk**: Safari quirks with SharedArrayBuffer\n  - **Mitigation**: Feature detect, fall back to single-threaded mode\n\n## Dependencies\n- Phase 0 must be complete (app scaffold exists)\n- Existing `phage.db` database file","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-12-07T21:56:12.864565Z","updated_at":"2025-12-08T06:03:08.196808Z","closed_at":"2025-12-08T06:03:08.196808Z","compaction_level":0,"original_size":0,"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"phage_explorer-pml","depends_on_id":"phage_explorer-87z","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-26T01:12:18Z","created_by":"import"}]}

SequenceGrid Integration\n\n**What**: Wire the existing SequenceGridRenderer (canvas-based) to the state store\n\n**Already exists**: \n- `visualization/sequence/SequenceGridRenderer.ts` (canvas rendering)\n- `hooks/useSequenceGrid.ts` (hook interface)\n\n**Needs**:\n- Connection to store's current phage sequence\n- Scroll position synchronization with store\n- DNA/AA view mode toggle\n- Reading frame support (1, 2, 3, -1, -2, -3)\n- Diff mode highlighting for comparisons\n\n### 3. GeneMap Enhancement\n\n**What**: Complete the canvas-based gene visualization bar\n\n**Already exists**: `components/GeneMapCanvas.tsx` (partial)\n\n**Needs**:\n- Full gene data rendering (start, end, strand, name)\n- Click-to-jump functionality (click gene → scroll to position)\n- Current position indicator (vertical line showing scroll position)\n- Gene hover tooltips with detailed info\n- Proper scale bar\n\n### 4. Header/Footer Data Binding\n\n**What**: Connect existing Header/Footer layout components to live data\n\n**Header needs**:\n- Current phage name\n- Genome length\n- GC content percentage\n- Current mode indicator (NORMAL/SEARCH/COMMAND)\n\n**Footer needs**:\n- Keyboard hints (context-sensitive)\n- Pending key sequence display\n- Analysis progress indicator\n- Database load status\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- **Depends on**: Phase 1 (Core Infrastructure)\n- **Blocks**: Phase 3-7 (need core views before overlays)\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n- [ ] PhageList displays all phages with virtualized scrolling\n- [ ] Can navigate PhageList with j/k keys\n- [ ] Selecting a phage loads its sequence into SequenceGrid\n- [ ] Sequence renders smoothly at 60fps\n- [ ] Can toggle DNA/AA view with 'v' key\n- [ ] GeneMap shows genes with click-to-navigate\n- [ ] Header shows current phage info\n- [ ] Footer shows keyboard hints\n\n## Files to Create/Modify\n\n```\npackages/web/src/components/\n├── PhageList.tsx           # NEW\n├── SequenceView.tsx        # NEW (wrapper for SequenceGridRenderer)\n├── GeneMapCanvas.tsx       # ENHANCE\n├── layout/\n│   ├── Header.tsx          # MODIFY (add data binding)\n│   └── Footer.tsx          # MODIFY (add data binding)\n```\n\n## Estimated Complexity: High\n\nThis phase involves significant UI work and must feel snappy. The virtualization and canvas rendering are performance-critical.","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-12-08T17:54:55.120129Z","updated_at":"2025-12-08T19:20:32.964787Z","closed_at":"2025-12-08T19:20:32.964787Z","compaction_level":0,"original_size":0,"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"phage_explorer-qiaq","depends_on_id":"phage_explorer-7y69","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-26T01:12:18Z","created_by":"import"}]}

While element colors are defined in `structure-loader.ts`, the visual result on dark backgrounds can still look like \"a big tangled mass.\"\n\n## Current State Analysis\n\n**File:** `/packages/web/src/visualization/structure-loader.ts`\n**Lines:** 45-59\n\n```typescript\nconst ELEMENT_COLORS: Record<string, Color> = {\n  H: new Color('#e0e0e0'),    // Light gray\n  C: new Color('#60a5fa'),    // Bright sky blue (NOT dark gray!)\n  N: new Color('#34d399'),    // Bright emerald green\n  O: new Color('#f87171'),    // Bright coral red\n  S: new Color('#fbbf24'),    // Bright amber\n  P: new Color('#c084fc'),    // Purple\n  MG: new Color('#4ade80'),   // Bright green\n  FE: new Color('#fb923c'),   // Orange\n  CA: new Color('#a3e635'),   // Lime\n  ZN: new Color('#7dd3fc'),   // Light blue\n  CL: new Color('#86efac'),   // Light green\n  NA: new Color('#fdba74'),   // Light orange\n};\n```\n\n## CPK Color Standard\n\nThe **CPK coloring scheme** (Corey-Pauling-Koltun) is the industry standard:\n\n| Element | CPK Color | Hex | Rationale |\n|---------|-----------|-----|-----------|\n| H | White | #FFFFFF | Smallest, most common |\n| C | Dark gray/black | #555555 | Carbon backbone |\n| N | Blue | #3050F8 | Nitrogen in proteins |\n| O | Red | #FF0D0D | Oxygen, polar |\n| S | Yellow | #FFFF30 | Sulfur bridges |\n| P | Orange | #FF8000 | Phosphate groups |\n| Cl | Green | #1FF01F | Halogen |\n| Fe | Orange-brown | #E06633 | Iron in heme |\n| Ca | Dark green | #3DFF00 | Calcium ions |\n| Mg | Dark green | #2A7800 | Magnesium |\n\n## Issues to Address\n\n1. **Carbon too bright:** Currently sky blue, should be darker gray\n2. **Low contrast between similar elements:** N and Cl both green-ish\n3. **Hydrogen too dark:** Should be brightest (white)\n4. **Need sphere scaling by element:** Hydrogen atoms should be smaller\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\n### 1. Update Color Palette to Modified CPK (Dark Theme Optimized)\n\n```typescript\nconst ELEMENT_COLORS: Record<string, Color> = {\n  H: new Color('#f8fafc'),    // Almost white (bright on dark bg)\n  C: new Color('#64748b'),    // Slate gray (neutral backbone)\n  N: new Color('#3b82f6'),    // True blue (nitrogen)\n  O: new Color('#ef4444'),    // True red (oxygen)\n  S: new Color('#fde047'),    // Bright yellow (sulfur)\n  P: new Color('#fb923c'),    // Orange (phosphorus)\n  MG: new Color('#22c55e'),   // Green (magnesium)\n  FE: new Color('#ea580c'),   // Rust orange (iron)\n  CA: new Color('#16a34a'),   // Dark green (calcium)\n  ZN: new Color('#7c3aed'),   // Purple (zinc)\n  CL: new Color('#4ade80'),   // Lime green (chlorine)\n  NA: new Color('#a855f7'),   // Violet (sodium)\n};\n```\n\n### 2. Add Element-Based Sphere Scaling\n\n```typescript\nconst ELEMENT_RADII: Record<string, number> = {\n  H: 0.25,   // Smallest\n  C: 0.40,   // Medium\n  N: 0.38,   // Slightly smaller than C\n  O: 0.35,   // Smaller than N\n  S: 0.50,   // Larger\n  P: 0.52,   // Larger\n  // ... etc\n};\n```\n\n### 3. Improve Material Properties\n\n```typescript\nconst atomMat = new MeshPhongMaterial({\n  vertexColors: true,\n  shininess: 100,        // Higher for more reflective spheres\n  specular: new Color('#ffffff'),  // White specular for better 3D feel\n});\n```\n\n## Files to Modify\n\n1. `/packages/web/src/visualization/structure-loader.ts`\n   - Update ELEMENT_COLORS\n   - Update ELEMENT_RADII\n   - Modify buildBallAndStick to use element-specific radii\n\n2. `/packages/web/src/components/Model3DView.tsx`\n   - Consider adding a color scheme selector (CPK/RasMol/Custom)\n\n## Testing\n\n- [ ] All common elements have distinct, recognizable colors\n- [ ] Works on both light and dark themes\n- [ ] Atoms are clearly distinguishable at default zoom\n- [ ] Larger structures remain readable\n\n## Definition of Done\n\n- [ ] CPK-derived color scheme implemented\n- [ ] Element-based sphere sizing\n- [ ] Clear visual distinction between C, N, O, S, P\n- [ ] Materials optimized for visibility on dark backgrounds","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-09T16:25:47.574575Z","updated_at":"2025-12-09T16:41:09.001156Z","closed_at":"2025-12-09T16:41:09.001156Z","compaction_level":0,"original_size":0,"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"phage_explorer-qm08","depends_on_id":"phage_explorer-vru3","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-26T01:12:18Z","created_by":"import"}]}

Update OverlayProvider\nDetect mobile viewport and render overlays differently:\n- Desktop: Centered modal (current)\n- Mobile: Bottom sheet (new)\n\nFile: packages/web/src/components/overlays/OverlayProvider.tsx\n\n### 2. Enhance BottomSheet Component\nAdd features to existing BottomSheet:\n- Snap points (25%, 50%, 90%)\n- Keyboard avoidance\n- Backdrop tap to close\n- Swipe velocity detection\n\nFile: packages/web/src/components/mobile/BottomSheet.tsx\n\n### 3.

{"id":"phage_explorer-s4qx","title":"Phase 7: Premium UX polish refresh (2026)","description":"## Why this exists\nA prior “Stripe-level” audit and polish pass was executed (see `phage_explorer-vntd`, closed 2025-12-13). Since then, new UI surfaces landed and some discoverability + consistency drift reappeared. This epic captures a **fresh-eyes, high-signal set of remaining + newly discovered polish work** for Phase 7.\n\n## High-level goal\nMake the product feel:\n- **Professional**: consistent visual language, predictable interactions, excellent empty/error/loading states.\n- **Fast**: perceived performance and responsiveness even during heavy compute.\n- **Trustworthy**: no mismatched shortcuts, no confusing controls, clear mental model.\n- **Accessible**: keyboard-first and screen-reader-friendly, with reduced-motion support.\n\n## Key findings (root causes)\n1) **Single-source-of-truth drift for shortcuts**\n   - Help/shortcut UI can fall out of sync with actual `useHotkey` bindings.\n   - Root cause: shortcuts are defined in multiple places (hook usage, overlay code, help overlay docs).\n\n2) **Overlay lazy-load vs hotkey registration paradox**\n   - Overlays are `React.lazy` (good for bundle + startup), but hotkeys often register inside overlay components.\n   - If we only mount overlays when opened, global shortcuts are missing until first open.\n   - If we mount all overlays for hotkeys, we lose lazy-load benefits.\n   - Root cause: hotkey registration is coupled to overlay component mount.\n\n3) **Design-system erosion**\n   - Inline styles and one-off CSS patterns reduce consistency, slow down future polish, and increase “paper cut” UI bugs.\n   - Root cause: no enforced set of primitives/tokens for overlay chrome, typography, spacing.\n\n4) **Typography mismatch**\n   - Global monospace in the web UI makes the product feel like a dev tool.\n   - Root cause: typography baseline chooses mono everywhere instead of mono-for-data.\n\n5) **Motion/FX defaults**\n   - Background FX can read as gimmicky or distract from analysis; must be subtle and respect device constraints.\n   - Root cause: FX toggles/defaults not guided by a clear “premium” motion policy.\n\n6) **Keyboard/focus handling inconsistency**\n   - Some components use ad-hoc `window.addEventListener('keydown')` patterns.\n   - Root cause: missing central conventions for where hotkeys live, how focus disables hotkeys, etc.\n\n## Success criteria (epic-level)\n- Help overlay and any shortcut UI is **always correct** (derived from a single registry).\n- Overlays remain truly lazy-loaded while global hotkeys stay available.\n- Overlay chrome feels consistent: header, actions, padding, spacing, typography, close affordances.\n- Default aesthetic is “quiet premium”: less “terminal gimmick”, more analysis-first clarity.\n- Reduced-motion users have a pleasant experience; heavy FX never degrade usability.\n\n## Execution model\nThis epic is executed via sub-epics:\n- Hotkeys + Help (registry + drift prevention)\n- Overlay architecture (true lazy overlays + global hotkeys)\n- Web design system (tokens, typography, primitives)\n- Motion/FX policy + defaults\n- Loading/empty/error polish\n- Keyboard/focus conventions and cleanups\n\nEach sub-epic includes acceptance criteria and small incremental steps (avoid sweeping refactors).\n","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2026-01-06T01:45:15.201726958Z","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-01-06T01:45:15.201726958Z","compaction_level":0,"original_size":0,"labels":["polish","tui","ux","web"],"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"phage_explorer-s4qx","depends_on_id":"phage_explorer-vntd","type":"relates-to","created_at":"2026-01-26T01:12:18Z","created_by":"import"},{"issue_id":"phage_explorer-s4qx","depends_on_id":"phage_explorer-wzjl","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-01-26T01:12:18Z","created_by":"import"}]}

{"id":"phage_explorer-ufj9","title":"Add swipe navigation indicator arrows on mobile","description":"## Problem\n\nThe app supports horizontal swipe gestures to navigate between phages, but there's NO visual indication this is possible. Mobile users have no way to discover this feature unless told.\n\n## Current State\n\n- Swipe handling exists in `App.tsx:440-519` - works but invisible\n- `mobile-ux.css` has `.gesture-hint` class defined but unused\n- ControlDeck has Prev/Next buttons but swipe is faster for browsing\n\n## Solution: Edge Swipe Indicators\n\nCreate persistent but subtle arrow indicators on left/right edges that:\n1. Show when on mobile AND when there are phages to navigate to\n2. Pulse/glow gently to attract attention (once per session)\n3. Fade during/after swipe gesture (visual feedback)\n4. Are positioned to avoid FAB and ControlDeck\n\n## Visual Design\n\n```\n┌─────────────────────────────────────┐\n│           PHAGE NAME                │\n│                                     │\n│  ◀        [main content]         ▶  │  <- Indicators at vertical center\n│                                     │\n│                                     │\n│  ┌─────────────────────────────┐    │\n│  │        ControlDeck          │    │\n└──┴─────────────────────────────┴────┘\n```\n\n- **Position**: Vertical center of viewport, just outside content padding\n- **Style**: Semi-transparent arrows with subtle animation\n- **Z-index**: `var(--z-sticky)` (200) - below FAB/ControlDeck (300), above content\n- **Visibility**: \n  - Left arrow hidden when at first phage (isFirst)\n  - Right arrow hidden when at last phage (isLast)\n\n## Implementation Plan\n\n### 1. Create SwipeIndicators component\n\n```tsx\n// packages/web/src/components/mobile/SwipeIndicators.tsx\ninterface SwipeIndicatorsProps {\n  isFirst: boolean;  // Hide left arrow\n  isLast: boolean;   // Hide right arrow\n  isVisible: boolean; // Master show/hide\n  showPulse?: boolean; // Animate for new users\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Add CSS with proper z-index\n\n```css\n/* packages/web/src/styles/swipe-indicators.css */\n.swipe-indicator {\n  position: fixed;\n  top: 50%;\n  transform: translateY(-50%);\n  z-index: var(--z-sticky); /* 200 - below FAB/ControlDeck (300), above content */\n  opacity: 0.6;\n  pointer-events: none; /* Decorative only */\n  transition: opacity var(--duration-normal);\n}\n.swipe-indicator--left { left: 8px; }\n.swipe-indicator--right { right: 8px; }\n.swipe-indicator--pulse { animation: swipe-hint-pulse 2s ease-in-out 3; }\n.swipe-indicator--subtle { opacity: 0.3; } /* For learned users */\n\n@keyframes swipe-hint-pulse {\n  0%, 100% { opacity: 0.6; transform: translateY(-50%) scale(1); }\n  50% { opacity: 1; transform: translateY(-50%) scale(1.1); }\n}\n\n@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {\n  .swipe-indicator--pulse { animation: none; }\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Integrate in App.tsx\n\n- Add SwipeIndicators to mobile render\n- Pass isFirst/isLast from phage navigation state\n- Show only when isMobile && phages.length > 1\n\n## Files to Create/Modify\n\n- CREATE: `packages/web/src/components/mobile/SwipeIndicators.tsx`\n- CREATE: `packages/web/src/styles/swipe-indicators.css`\n- MODIFY: `packages/web/src/App.tsx` (add component)\n- MODIFY: `packages/web/src/styles/index.css` (import new CSS)\n\n## Accessibility Considerations\n\n- Arrows are decorative/hinting only, not interactive\n- Use aria-hidden=\"true\" since swipe is supplemental to Prev/Next buttons\n- Ensure reduced-motion preference disables pulse animation\n- pointer-events: none ensures they don't interfere with touch\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- Left/right arrow indicators appear on mobile viewports\n- Arrows correctly hide at navigation boundaries (first/last phage)\n- Arrows use correct z-index (below FAB/ControlDeck)\n- Pulse animation plays on first appearance, then stops\n- Indicators respect prefers-reduced-motion\n- Arrows don't interfere with touch/swipe gestures","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-16T17:35:50.151534666Z","updated_at":"2025-12-16T17:48:18.224836920Z","closed_at":"2025-12-16T17:48:18.224836920Z","close_reason":"Implemented SwipeIndicators component with CSS animations, integrated into App.tsx with isFirst/isLast boundary handling","compaction_level":0,"original_size":0,"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"phage_explorer-ufj9","depends_on_id":"phage_explorer-2yf3","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-26T01:12:18Z","created_by":"import"}]}

{"id":"phage_explorer-vs9k","title":"Pillar 5: Context-Aware Help System","description":"## Smart Explanations That Appear When Relevant\n\n### Philosophy\nInstead of requiring users to seek out help, context-aware explanations appear automatically based on what the user is viewing. This creates a 'just-in-time learning' experience.\n\n### How It Works\n1. **InfoButton Component** - Small [?] icons placed next to technical displays\n2. **ContextPanel Component** - Slides in with relevant explanation\n3. **useContextHelp Hook** - Determines what explanation to show based on current view\n\n### Context Triggers\n\n**When viewing DNA sequence:**\n- What are these letters? (A, T, G, C)\n- Why are some colored differently?\n- What does the position number mean?\n\n**When viewing amino acids:**\n- How did DNA become amino acids?\n- What do the colors represent?\n- What is a reading frame?\n\n**When viewing genes:**\n- What is a gene/ORF?\n- What do start/end positions mean?\n- What is a locus tag?\n\n**When using analysis overlays:**\n- GC Skew: Why does GC content vary? What does skew indicate?\n- Complexity: What is sequence entropy? Why does it matter?\n- Repeats: What are direct/inverted repeats? Why important?\n- HGT: What is horizontal gene transfer?\n- CRISPR: What is CRISPR? How do spacers work?\n- Synteny: What is gene order conservation?\n- Dot Plot: How do I read this matrix?\n\n### Implementation\n\n**ContextPanel Component:**\n- Slides in from right side\n- Title, explanation text, diagrams\n- Links to: glossary terms, full module, visualizer\n- Dismiss button, auto-dismiss on navigation\n\n**InfoButton Component:**\n- Consistent [?] icon style\n- Hover preview (short), click for full panel\n- Only visible in Beginner Mode\n\n**ContextProvider:**\n- Wraps app, tracks current context\n- Provides `showContext(topicId)` function\n- Manages panel open/close state\n\n### Content Structure\nEach context help entry has:\n- `id`: unique identifier\n- `title`: what is this?\n- `shortExplanation`: 1-2 sentences\n- `fullExplanation`: detailed (2-3 paragraphs)\n- `glossaryTerms`: linked terms\n- `relatedModule`: link to foundational module\n- `visualizer`: optional interactive element\n\n### Files to Create\n- packages/web/src/education/context/ContextPanel.tsx\n- packages/web/src/education/context/ContextProvider.tsx\n- packages/web/src/education/components/InfoButton.tsx\n- packages/web/src/education/context/topics/*.ts (content files)\n- packages/web/src/education/hooks/useContextHelp.ts\n\n### Integration Points\n- SequenceView: add info buttons for DNA/AA display\n- GeneMapCanvas: add info for gene annotations\n- Each overlay: add context explanation header\n- ComparisonOverlay: explain metrics\n\n### Why This Pillar Matters\nThis is the 'magic' of Beginner Mode—help appears exactly when needed without the user having to search.

{"id":"phage_explorer-xivy","title":"Web Feature Parity & Mobile Excellence","description":"# Epic: Web Feature Parity & Mobile Excellence\n\n## Executive Summary\n\nThis epic represents the strategic initiative to achieve full feature parity between the TUI and Web versions of Phage Explorer, while simultaneously establishing the Web version as a world-class mobile experience. The goal is not mere replication but intelligent adaptation—leveraging the unique strengths of each platform.\n\n## Background & Rationale\n\n### Current State Analysis\n\n**TUI (Terminal UI) - 1100+ lines App.tsx**\n- 50+ components, 40+ specialized analysis overlays\n- 6 fully-implemented interactive simulations\n- 56+ keyboard shortcuts across 7 categories\n- Progressive experience system (novice→intermediate→power)\n- Complete genomic analysis toolkit\n\n**Web (Browser) - Current State**\n- 43 overlay types defined, many incomplete\n- 10 simulation types registered, visualizers partial\n- 40+ keyboard shortcuts (good coverage)\n- Mobile support exists but cell sizes problematic\n- Canvas rendering works but needs optimization\n\n### The Gap\n\n1. **Mobile UX**: Cells too small for letters at default zoom; orientation changes not leveraged\n2. **Analysis Overlays**: ~12 overlays incomplete or missing visualizations\n3. **Simulation Visualizers**: 6 simulations need complete visualization components\n4. **Progressive Disclosure**: Experience gating exists in state but not wired to UI\n5. **3D Model**: Quality presets work but mobile-specific optimizations missing\n\n## Strategic Goals\n\n1. **100% Feature Parity**: Every TUI feature accessible via Web\n2. **Mobile-First Excellence**: Touch-optimized, orientation-aware, readable at all sizes\n3. **World-Class UX**: Discoverable, learnable, powerful\n4. **Performance**: 60fps rendering, <100ms interactions, offline-capable\n5. **Accessibility**: WCAG AA compliance, keyboard-only navigation, screen reader support\n\n## Success Metrics\n\n- All 40+ TUI overlays functional in Web\n- All 6 simulations with complete visualizers\n- Mobile NPS > 50 (Net Promoter Score)\n- Lighthouse Performance > 90\n- Time-to-Interactive < 3s on 3G\n\n## Architecture Principles\n\n1. **Shared Core**: Maximum code reuse via @phage-explorer/core\n2. **Platform Adaptation**: TUI-optimized ≠ Web-optimized; adapt intelligently\n3. **Progressive Enhancement**: Core features work without JS; enhanced with it\n4. **Lazy Loading**: Load analysis algorithms on-demand via Web Workers\n5. **Responsive First**: Design mobile, enhance for desktop\n\n## Pillars of Work\n\n### Pillar 1: Mobile Sequence Grid Excellence\nFix the current mobile grid issues and make it genuinely useful for genomic exploration.\n\n### Pillar 2: Responsive & Orientation-Aware Layout  \nIntelligent layout adaptation for portrait/landscape and all device sizes.\n\n### Pillar 3: Complete Analysis Overlay Parity\nImplement all 40+ TUI overlays with Web-optimized visualizations.\n\n### Pillar 4: Simulation Visualizer Parity\nComplete all 6 simulation visualizers with interactive controls.\n\n### Pillar 5: Keyboard/Command Parity\nEnsure all TUI hotkeys work in Web with proper conflict resolution.\n\n### Pillar 6: Progressive Disclosure & UX Polish\nWire experience levels to UI, implement onboarding, feature tours.\n\n### Pillar 7: 3D Visualization Parity\nMobile-optimized 3D with LOD, touch controls, quality presets.\n\n### Pillar 8: Performance & Offline\nService worker optimization, lazy loading, cache strategies.\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- Existing @phage-explorer/core algorithms (complete)\n- Existing @phage-explorer/state store (complete)  \n- Web Workers infrastructure (exists, needs expansion)\n- Canvas rendering system (exists, needs optimization)\n\n## Timeline Estimate\n\nNot providing time estimates per project guidelines. Work should be prioritized by impact and dependencies.\n\n## Risk Factors\n\n1. WebGL/WebGPU compatibility across mobile browsers\n2. Memory constraints on older mobile devices\n3. Touch gesture conflicts with browser gestures\n4. IndexedDB storage limits for large genomes\n","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-12-09T05:33:27.756677Z","updated_at":"2026-01-08T22:45:52.065301Z","closed_at":"2025-12-19T03:55:02.105955360Z","compaction_level":0,"original_size":0}

So why isn't it showing?\n\n## Investigation Tasks\n\n### 1. Check Database Build\nVerify the phage.db contains all 12 phages:\n```bash\nbun run build:db\nsqlite3 phage.db \"SELECT name, pdb_ids FROM phages ORDER BY name\"\n```\n\n### 2. Check Web Repository Query\n**File:** `/packages/web/src/db/SqlJsRepository.ts`\n\nVerify `listPhages()` returns all phages:\n```typescript\nconst result = this.db.exec(`\n  SELECT id, name, accession, family, ...\n  FROM phages\n  ORDER BY name\n`);\n```\n\n### 3. Check 3D Model Loading\nFor each phage, verify:\n1. `phage.pdbIds` array is populated\n2. First PDB ID resolves to a valid RCSB URL\n3. Structure loads without error\n\n### 4. RCSB Availability\nSome older PDB entries may have been superseded or removed. Check each PDB ID:\n```bash\nfor pdb in 7VI9 8K35 5VF3 3J4G 2BPA 2MS2 2MJZ 5UU5 1MN8 4FCY 4BTG 5Y24 8ZVI; do\n  curl -s -o /dev/null -w \"%{http_code} $pdb\\n\" https://files.rcsb.org/download/$pdb.pdb\ndone\n```\n\n## Potential Issues\n\n### Issue 1: Database Not Rebuilt\nIf `bun run build:db` hasn't been run after catalog updates, the database may be stale.\n\n### Issue 2: JSON Parsing\nPDB IDs are stored as JSON in SQLite. Check parsing:\n```typescript\npdbIds: safeJsonParse<string[]>(phage.pdbIds, []),\n```\n\n### Issue 3: Web App Cache\nIndexedDB may have cached an older database version.\n\n## Remediation Steps\n\n1. **Rebuild database:**\n   ```bash\n   rm phage.db\n   bun run build:db\n   ```\n\n2. **Clear web app cache:**\n   - Open DevTools > Application > IndexedDB\n   - Delete phage-explorer database\n   - Reload\n\n3. **Verify all phages load:**\n   - Each phage should appear in the list\n   - Each phage with PDB IDs should show 3D model\n\n## Testing Checklist\n\n- [ ] Lambda phage appears in the list\n- [ ] Lambda 3D model loads (PDB 7VI9 or 8K35)\n- [ ] All 12 catalog phages appear\n- [ ] All 12 phages have working 3D models\n- [ ] No console errors during structure loading\n\n## Definition of Done\n\n- [ ] All 12 catalog phages visible in web UI\n- [ ] All phages with PDB IDs load 3D structures\n- [ ] Any missing/broken PDB IDs replaced with alternatives\n- [ ] Database rebuild script works correctly","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-09T16:25:47.724489Z","updated_at":"2025-12-09T16:44:14.817108Z","closed_at":"2025-12-09T16:44:14.817108Z","compaction_level":0,"original_size":0,"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"phage_explorer-z49z","depends_on_id":"phage_explorer-vru3","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-26T01:12:18Z","created_by":"import"}]}
