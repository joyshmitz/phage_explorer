{"id":"phage_explorer-0k6","title":"Layer 3: Temporal Evolution Replay","description":"## Temporal Evolution Replay (Layer 3 Simulation)\n\n### Concept\n\nEvolution is not a photograph — it's a **movie**. When we have multiple isolates of related phages collected over time (e.g., longitudinal coevolution studies, historical laboratory stocks), we can reconstruct **how the genome changed through time**.\n\nThis feature creates an **animated time-lapse of evolution**, showing:\n- When and where each mutation appeared\n- How **effective population size (Ne)** changed (population dynamics)\n- The **substitution rate** (molecular clock calibration)\n- Branches where lineages diverged\n\nThe key mathematical tool is the **dated phylogenetic tree** — a tree where branch lengths are calibrated to real time rather than genetic distance. Combined with ancestral sequence reconstruction, we can \"play back\" evolution.\n\n### Mathematical Foundations\n\n**Molecular Clock Hypothesis:**\n```\nSubstitutions accumulate at roughly constant rate:\n  genetic_distance ≈ μ × t × 2  (for two taxa)\nWhere:\n  μ = substitution rate (subs/site/year)\n  t = divergence time\nFor phages: μ ≈ 10⁻⁵ to 10⁻³ subs/site/year (much faster than most organisms)\n```\n\n**Root-to-tip Regression (clock test):**\n```\nFor each taxon i with sampling date tᵢ:\n  dᵢ = genetic distance from root to tip\nLinear regression: dᵢ = μ × tᵢ + c\nGood clock: R² \u003e 0.8, p \u003c 0.05\ntMRCA = -c / μ (time to most recent common ancestor)\n```\n\n**Least-Squares Dating (LSD2 algorithm):**\n```\nGiven unrooted tree T with branch lengths and tip dates {t₁...tₙ}:\nMinimize: Σᵢⱼ (dᵢⱼ - |tᵢ - tⱼ|×μ)²\nSubject to: all internal node dates \u003c descendant dates\nOutput: Dated tree with internal node dates\n```\n\n**Coalescent Skyline (Population Dynamics):**\n```\nE[waiting time for k → k-1 lineages] = Ne × 2 / (k(k-1))\nSkyline plot: Estimate Ne at each coalescent interval\nReveals population crashes (bottlenecks) and expansions\n```\n\n**Ancestral Sequence Reconstruction (Felsenstein):**\n```\nMaximum Likelihood at each internal node:\nP(node = A) = Σₓ P(left=x|node=A) × P(right=y|node=A) × P(A→x) × P(A→y)\nMarginal reconstruction: Most likely state at each position\n```\n\n### Implementation Approach\n\n**Core interfaces:**\n```typescript\ninterface DatedSequence {\n  id: string;\n  sequence: string;\n  collectionDate: Date;\n  location?: string;\n}\n\ninterface ClockAnalysis {\n  rate: number;              // subs/site/year\n  rateCI: [number, number];  // 95% CI\n  tmrca: Date;               // Time to MRCA\n  r2: number;                // Regression fit\n  clockLike: boolean;        // Is clock model appropriate?\n}\n\ninterface DatedTree {\n  tree: NewickTree;\n  nodeHeights: Map\u003cstring, number\u003e;  // Node ID -\u003e date\n  rate: number;\n}\n\ninterface AncestralReconstruction {\n  nodeSequences: Map\u003cstring, string\u003e;\n  mutations: MutationEvent[];\n  confidence: Map\u003cstring, Float32Array\u003e;\n}\n\ninterface EvolutionFrame {\n  time: number;\n  displayDate: string;\n  sequence: string;\n  mutations: { position: number; from: string; to: string }[];\n  activeBranches: string[];\n  neAtTime: number;\n  cumulativeMutations: number;\n}\n```\n\n**Animation frame generator** yields frames for smooth playback with mutations appearing at interpolated times.\n\n### TUI Visualization\n\n```\nTemporal Evolution Replay: Lambda isolates (1950-2020)\n═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\n\nTime: ████████████████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░  1985-03-12\n      1950                     2020\n\nTree (branches alive highlighted):\n                ┌──● Lambda-1950 (ancestor)\n            ┌───┤\n        ┌───┤   └──○ Lambda-1962\n    ────┤   └──────────● Lambda-1985 ← YOU ARE HERE\n        └──────────────────○ Lambda-2020 (future)\n\nSequence at 1985-03-12:\nPosition:  12450  12451  12452  12453\nAncestral:   A      T      G      C\nCurrent:     A      T      C*     C    ← MUTATION!

Any frame drops or latency destroys the \"instant feedback\" experience that defines Phage Explorer.\n\n## Design Philosophy\nWe render to Canvas 2D (not DOM) because:\n1. **Performance**: DOM cannot achieve 60fps with 5000+ colored elements\n2. **Control**: Pixel-perfect cyberpunk aesthetics\n3. **Consistency**: Same visual output across browsers\n\nWebGL is used for post-processing effects (glow, scanlines) that would be expensive in 2D.\n\n## Deliverables\n1. **Canvas Sequence Grid Renderer** - Main rendering engine\n2. **Glyph Atlas** - Pre-rendered character sprites\n3. **Virtual Scrolling** - Efficient rendering of 100k+ sequences\n4. **Gene Map Renderer** - Canvas/SVG hybrid\n5. **Sparkline Components** - Ported from TUI\n6. **WebGL Post-Processing** - Shaders for effects\n\n## Technical Architecture\n\n### SequenceGridRenderer\n```typescript\n- OffscreenCanvas double-buffering\n- High-DPI support (devicePixelRatio)\n- Dirty region tracking for partial updates\n- Color batching (group characters by color)\n- requestAnimationFrame scheduling\n```\n\n### GlyphAtlas\n```typescript\n- Pre-render all nucleotides (ACGTN) + amino acids\n- Single canvas texture for all characters\n- drawGlyph() copies from atlas to destination\n- ~10x faster than fillText() per character\n```\n\n### Virtual Scrolling\n```typescript\n- Only render visible rows + overscan\n- Smooth scroll with momentum physics\n- Prefetch ahead of scroll direction\n- 60fps target with 100k+ bases\n```\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] 60fps scrolling on 100k+ base sequences\n- [ ] All nucleotide/amino acid colors match TUI\n- [ ] Gene map shows correct positions and strands\n- [ ] Scanlines and glow effects render correctly\n- [ ] High-DPI displays render crisply\n- [ ] Memory usage stable during extended scrolling\n\n## Performance Targets\n| Metric | Target |\n|--------|--------|\n| Frame time | \u003c16.67ms |\n| First paint | \u003c100ms |\n| Scroll latency | \u003c8ms |\n| Memory (100k seq) | \u003c50MB |\n\n## Risks \u0026 Mitigations\n- **Risk**: Canvas performance varies across browsers\n  - **Mitigation**: Test Safari, use conservative techniques\n- **Risk**: Glyph atlas memory\n  - **Mitigation**: Generate at runtime, don't ship as image\n- **Risk**: WebGL shader complexity\n  - **Mitigation**: Simple shaders first, optimize later\n\n## Dependencies\n- Phase 0 (app scaffold with theme system)\n- Phase 1 (database for sequence data)","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-12-07T16:56:14.282689-05:00","updated_at":"2025-12-07T18:04:37.240754-05:00","closed_at":"2025-12-07T18:04:37.240754-05:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"phage_explorer-10p","depends_on_id":"phage_explorer-87z","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-07T17:04:30.294827-05:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"phage_explorer-10p","depends_on_id":"phage_explorer-pml","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-07T17:04:31.525345-05:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}

{"id":"phage_explorer-4ty","title":"Advanced: Phage Cocktail Compatibility Matrix","description":"## Phage Cocktail Compatibility Matrix (Advanced Feature)\n\n### Concept\n\nPhage therapy rarely uses single phages — **cocktails** of multiple phages are essential to:\n1. Cover diverse host strains\n2. Prevent resistance emergence\n3. Ensure redundant killing mechanisms\n\nBut not all phages work together. Some interfere through:\n- **Superinfection exclusion (Sie)**: One phage blocks another from entering\n- **Receptor competition**: Both need same receptor (one wins)\n- **Lysis timing conflicts**: Different burst schedules cause resource waste\n- **Immunity/Lysogeny**: Temperate phage provides immunity against related phages\n\nThis feature computes a **compatibility matrix** across all phages and solves the **optimal cocktail selection problem**: find the minimal set covering target host range with no compatibility conflicts.\n\n### Mathematical Foundations\n\n**Compatibility scoring:**\n```\nFor phages A and B, compatibility score C(A,B) ∈ [-1, +1]:\n\nPositive factors (synergy):\n  - Different receptors: +0.3\n  - Different lysis timing (early + late): +0.2\n  - Complementary host ranges: +0.3\n  - No sequence homology in immunity regions: +0.2\n\nNegative factors (interference):\n  - Same receptor: -0.4\n  - Superinfection exclusion genes detected: -0.5\n  - Similar lysis timing: -0.2\n  - Sie genes present in both: -0.3\n  - One temperate provides immunity to other: -0.8\n\nC(A,B) = Σ positive_factors - Σ negative_factors (clamped to [-1, +1])\n```\n\n**Host range coverage:**\n```\nLet H = {h₁, h₂, ..., hₘ} = target hosts\nLet P = {p₁, p₂, ..., pₙ} = candidate phages\nLet R[i,j] = 1 if phage pᵢ infects host hⱼ, else 0\n\nCoverage of subset S ⊆ P:\n  Cov(S) = { hⱼ : ∃ pᵢ ∈ S with R[i,j] = 1 }\n```\n\n**Optimal cocktail as Set Cover + Compatibility (NP-hard):**\n```\nMaximize: |Cov(S)| (hosts covered)\nSubject to:\n  |S| ≤ k (max cocktail size, typically 3-5)\n  ∀ pᵢ, pⱼ ∈ S: C(pᵢ, pⱼ) \u003e threshold (no conflicts)\n\nSolutions:\n  - Greedy: Add phage with best coverage/compatibility ratio\n  - ILP: Optimal but slower\n  - Genetic algorithm: For large phage libraries\n```\n\n**ILP formulation:**\n```\nVariables:\n  xᵢ ∈ {0,1} = 1 if phage i selected\n  yⱼ ∈ {0,1} = 1 if host j covered\n\nMaximize: Σⱼ yⱼ\nSubject to:\n  Σᵢ xᵢ ≤ k                           (cocktail size limit)\n  yⱼ ≤ Σᵢ R[i,j] × xᵢ                 (coverage constraint)\n  xᵢ + xⱼ ≤ 1 for incompatible pairs  (compatibility constraint)\n```\n\n### Implementation Approach\n\n**Feature extraction for compatibility:**\n```typescript\ninterface PhageInterferenceFeatures {\n  phageId: number;\n  receptorGenes: string[];          // e.g., ['OmpC', 'LamB']\n  sieGenes: string[];               // Superinfection exclusion\n  lysisTime: 'early' | 'middle' | 'late';\n  lifecycle: 'lytic' | 'temperate';\n  immunityRegion?: string;          // For temperate phages\n  hostRange: Set\u003cstring\u003e;           // Confirmed hosts\n}\n```\n\n**Pairwise compatibility calculation:**\n```typescript\ninterface CompatibilityScore {\n  phageA: number;\n  phageB: number;\n  score: number;  // -1 to +1\n  factors: { name: string; contribution: number; reason: string }[];\n  compatible: boolean;  // score \u003e threshold\n}\n\n// Compute receptor overlap, Sie presence, lysis timing,\n// immunity cross-reaction, host range complementarity\n```\n\n**Optimal cocktail solver (greedy):**\n```typescript\ninterface CocktailSolution {\n  phages: number[];\n  coverage: string[];  // Hosts covered\n  coveragePercent: number;\n  compatibilityScore: number;  // Average pairwise score\n  rationale: string[];\n}\n\n// While selected.length \u003c maxSize and covered.size \u003c targetHosts.length:\n//   Find best phage (compatible + max marginal coverage)\n//   Add to selection, update covered set\n```\n\n### TUI Visualization\n\n```\nPhage Cocktail Compatibility Matrix\n═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\n\nCompatibility Heatmap (12 phages):\n          │ λ   T4  T7  P22 M13 Mu  Φ29 Φ6  T5  SPβ HK97 P1  │\n──────────┼─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤\nLambda    │ ·   +0.6 +0.4 -0.3 +0.8 +0.2 +0.5 +0.7 +0.1 -0.7 +0.3 +0.4 │\nT4        │     ·    +0.5 +0.6 +0.7 +0.3 +0.4 +0.8 +0.6 +0.4 +0.5 +0.5 │\nT7        │          ·    +0.5 +0.6 +0.4 +0.8 +0.7 +0.3 +0.3 +0.4 +0.5 │\nP22       │               ·    +0.5 -0.2 +0.3 +0.6 +0.4 +0.5 -0.4 +0.3 │\n...       │                                                             │\n──────────┴─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\n\nLegend: ▓▓▓ +0.8 ▒▒▒ +0.4 ░░░ 0.0 ··· -0.4 ▫▫▫ -0.8\n\n⚠ Incompatible pairs:\n  Lambda × SPbeta (-0.7): Cross-immunity (temperate, 78% identity)\n  Lambda × P22 (-0.3): Same receptor (LamB)\n\n───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nCOCKTAIL OPTIMIZER\n\nTarget hosts: E. coli K-12, B, C; Salmonella; P. aeruginosa (5 total)\n\n✓ RECOMMENDED COCKTAIL:\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│  1.

This provides quantitative guidance.\n2. **Resistance prevention**: Cocktails are essential but bad combinations are worse than single phages.\n3. **Scalable optimization**: As phage libraries grow (thousands), manual selection becomes impossible.\n4. **Explainable recommendations**: Not just \"use these\" but \"because X covers Y, and Z adds receptor diversity.\"\n5. **Novel contribution**: No existing tool combines compatibility scoring with coverage optimization.\n\n### Innovation Assessment\n\n**Novelty: VERY HIGH** - First computational compatibility predictor for phages. First cocktail optimization solver. Novel integration of molecular interference mechanisms.\n\n**Pedagogical Value: 9/10** - Teaches Sie, receptor competition, immunity, combinatorial optimization (set cover, ILP, greedy), therapy design principles.\n\n**Wow Factor: 9/10** - Heatmap with green (compatible) and red (incompatible) is immediately intuitive. Watching algorithm select optimal cocktail with rationale feels like having an expert consultant.\n\n### Data Requirements\n- Phage interference features (receptors, Sie genes, lysis timing)\n- Host range data (which phages infect which hosts)\n- Immunity region sequences (for temperate phages)","status":"open","priority":3,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-12-06T23:20:17.845538-05:00","updated_at":"2025-12-06T23:46:06.517103-05:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"phage_explorer-4ty","depends_on_id":"phage_explorer-54g","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-06T23:20:17.848483-05:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}

This phase creates the scaffolding that all subsequent phases will build upon.\n\n## Why This Matters\nA solid foundation prevents rework later. By establishing the package structure, build tooling, theme system, and keyboard handling first, all subsequent development follows consistent patterns and shares common infrastructure.\n\n## Deliverables\n1. **Package Scaffold** - `packages/web` with Vite + React 19\n2. **Path Aliases** - Configured imports for `@phage-explorer/*` shared packages\n3. **Layout Shell** - Header, Main content area, Footer components\n4. **Theme System** - Full port of TUI themes with CSS variables\n5. **Keyboard Manager** - Hotkey registration, vim-style modal support\n6. **CSS Foundation** - Reset, typography, base variables\n\n## Technical Decisions\n- **Vite over Next.js**: No SSR needed, Vite is faster and simpler\n- **React 19**: Concurrent features for smooth updates\n- **CSS Modules + Variables**: Scoped styles, zero runtime, theme tokens\n- **No UI library**: Custom primitives for maximum control over cyberpunk aesthetic\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] App boots in browser without errors\n- [ ] Theme switching works (all 10 themes from TUI)\n- [ ] Basic keyboard shortcuts respond (arrow keys, Escape, ?)\n- [ ] Build produces optimized bundle (\u003c200KB initial)\n- [ ] TypeScript compilation passes with strict mode\n- [ ] Shared packages (@core, @state) import correctly\n\n## Risks \u0026 Mitigations\n- **Risk**: Path alias resolution issues with Vite\n  - **Mitigation**: Test imports early, configure tsconfig.json properly\n- **Risk**: Theme token explosion\n  - **Mitigation**: Use semantic tokens mapped to theme palettes\n\n## Dependencies\n- Existing `@phage-explorer/core` package\n- Existing `@phage-explorer/state` package\n\n## Implementation Notes\nThe keyboard manager should support vim-style modal patterns (NORMAL, SEARCH, COMMAND, VISUAL modes) from day one. This is fundamental to the keyboard-first design philosophy.\n\nFont loading strategy: Self-host JetBrains Mono with font-display: swap for fast rendering.","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-12-07T16:56:11.524254-05:00","updated_at":"2025-12-07T17:33:52.685672-05:00","closed_at":"2025-12-07T17:33:52.685672-05:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"phage_explorer-87z","depends_on_id":"phage_explorer-sar","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-07T17:04:28.695388-05:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}

Project to 2D: PC1 = X_centered * v1, PC2 = X_centered * v2\n\n**Variance Explained**:\nVariance by PCk = lambda_k / sum(lambda_i)\nTypically:\n- PC1: 30-50% (often correlates with GC content)\n- PC2: 10-20% (often reflects purine/pyrimidine bias)\n\n**Distance in PCA Space**:\nd(i,j) = sqrt((PC1_i - PC1_j)^2 + (PC2_i - PC2_j)^2)\nCorrelates with taxonomic distance, host range overlap, divergence time\n\n### Implementation\n\n**Core Interfaces**:\n```typescript\ninterface KmerVector {\n  phageId: number;\n  name: string;\n  frequencies: Float32Array;  // 256 elements\n  gcContent: number;\n}\n\ninterface PCAResult {\n  projections: { phageId: number; name: string; pc1: number; pc2: number }[];\n  eigenvalues: number[];\n  varianceExplained: number[];\n  loadings: Float32Array[];  // Which 4-mers contribute to each PC\n}\n```\n\n**computeKmerFrequencies()**: Single pass through sequence, encode 4-mers as indices 0-255, count and normalize\n\n**computePCA()**: Center data, power iteration for top eigenvectors, project data\n\n**renderPCAPlot()**: ASCII scatter plot with axes, point labels, cluster annotations\n\n### TUI Visualization\n\n```\n╭───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮\n│  GENOMIC SIGNATURE PCA: Tetranucleotide Frequencies                      │\n├───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤\n│                                                                           │\n│  PC1 (43.2% variance) vs PC2 (16.7% variance)                            │\n│                                                                           │\n│  PC2 ↑                                                                    │\n│      │                                                                    │\n│  0.3 │                    ●T7                                             │\n│      │                   ● ●                   ●Phi29                     │\n│  0.2 │                  ●   (T7-like)            ●                        │\n│      │                 ●                                                  │\n│  0.1 │                                                                    │\n│      │  ●MS2                                                              │\n│  0.0 │───────────────────────────────────●Lambda───────────────→ PC1     │\n│      │       ●PhiX174                        ●                            │\n│ -0.1 │         (ssDNA cluster)              ●P22                          │\n│      │      ●M13                                                          │\n│ -0.2 │                                                                    │\n│      │                                        ◉ YOU ARE HERE              │\n│ -0.3 │                           ●T4           (T4-like cluster)          │\n│      │                          ●SPbeta ●T5                               │\n│ -0.4 └──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────          │\n│     -0.4  -0.3  -0.2  -0.1   0.0   0.1   0.2   0.3   0.4   0.5            │\n│                                                                           │\n│  Clusters: T7-like (high GC) | T4-like (AT-rich) | ssDNA | Lambda-like   │\n│  [Click] Inspect  [Z] Zoom  [3] Add PC3  [E] Export  [ESC] Exit          │\n╰───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯\n```\n\n### Assessment\n- Novelty: 7/10 - Technique known but rarely in user-facing phage tools, TUI scatter novel\n- Pedagogical: 9/10 - Teaches PCA, genomic signatures, alignment-free methods, multivariate stats\n- Cool Factor: 8/10 - Proximity = relatedness is satisfying visualization\n\n### Files\n- packages/tui/src/components/PCAView.tsx\n- packages/core/src/analysis/kmer-frequencies.ts\n- packages/core/src/analysis/pca.ts","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-12-06T23:15:45.104077-05:00","updated_at":"2025-12-07T00:08:37.368039-05:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"phage_explorer-c3j","depends_on_id":"phage_explorer-54g","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-06T23:15:45.105973-05:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}

Command palette, analysis menus, overlays, and help systems.\n\n## Why This Matters\nThe keyboard-first design requires a sophisticated command palette and hotkey system. Analysis overlays are how users extract insights from sequences. Without this layer, the app is just a viewer, not an explorer.\n\n## Design Principles\n1. **Every action has a hotkey** - No mouse-required features\n2. **Fuzzy search everywhere** - Command palette, search, menus\n3. **Modal consistency** - All panels behave the same way\n4. **Layer stacking** - Multiple overlays can be active\n\n## Deliverables\n1. **Command Palette** - Fuzzy search, keyboard navigation, `:` trigger\n2. **Analysis Menu** - Drawer with all analysis options\n3. **Simulation Hub** - Modal launcher for simulations\n4. **Layer 1 Overlays** - GC, complexity, bendability, promoter, repeat\n5. **Multi-Overlay Manager** - Stack management, z-index, focus trap\n6. **Help Overlay** - Dynamic hotkey reference\n\n## Component Architecture\n\n### Command Palette\n```\nFeatures:\n- Fuzzy search with highlighting\n- Category grouping (theme:, overlay:, sim:, export:)\n- Recent commands\n- Keyboard navigation (↑↓, Enter, Tab complete)\n- Cyberpunk styling (glow, scanlines)\n```\n\n### Overlay Stack Manager\n```typescript\nclass OverlayStackManager {\n  push(overlay): void      // Add overlay to stack\n  pop(id?): void           // Remove overlay\n  toggle(overlay): void    // Toggle overlay visibility\n  getTopmost(): Overlay    // For focus management\n  hasBlockingModal(): bool // Prevent background interaction\n}\n```\n\n### Panel System\n```\nPositions: left, right, bottom, center\nSizes: sm, md, lg, xl, full\nFeatures:\n- Focus trapping\n- Escape to close\n- Spring animations\n- Scanline overlay decoration\n```\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] All hotkeys from TUI work in web app\n- [ ] Command palette with fuzzy search\n- [ ] Overlays toggle correctly with hotkeys\n- [ ] Multiple overlays can stack visually\n- [ ] Panel animations are smooth (60fps)\n- [ ] Help overlay shows all current hotkeys\n- [ ] Focus trap works for modals\n\n## Hotkey Parity Checklist\n```\nNavigation: ↑↓←→, hjkl, gg, G, Ctrl+g\nView: Space, 1/2/3, f, t, T, d, m, M, z\nOverlays: g, x, b, p, r, J, L, V, Y, 0\nPanels: a/A, S, :, w/W, /, s, ?, Ctrl+p\n```\n\n## Risks \u0026 Mitigations\n- **Risk**: Fuzzy search performance with many commands\n  - **Mitigation**: Use efficient algorithm (fzy/fzf-style)\n- **Risk**: Focus management complexity\n  - **Mitigation**: Use React focus trap library, test thoroughly\n- **Risk**: Animation performance\n  - **Mitigation**: Use CSS transforms, avoid layout thrashing\n\n## Dependencies\n- Phase 0 (keyboard manager)\n- Phase 2 (core visualization to overlay on)","status":"open","priority":0,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-12-07T16:56:15.528715-05:00","updated_at":"2025-12-07T16:56:15.528715-05:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"phage_explorer-ee1","depends_on_id":"phage_explorer-87z","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-07T17:04:32.337246-05:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"phage_explorer-ee1","depends_on_id":"phage_explorer-10p","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-07T17:04:33.281302-05:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}

An Iterated Function System maps nucleotides to unit square corners, creating unique visual signatures that encode complete k-mer frequency spectra. Features Braille-character TUI rendering (8x resolution), interactive zoom into k-mer space, side-by-side comparison, and reveals CpG suppression, codon bias, and horizontal gene transfer signatures. Novelty: 9/10, Pedagogical: 9/10, Cool Factor: 10/10.","notes":"## CHAOS GAME REPRESENTATION (CGR) FRACTAL FINGERPRINTS\n\n**Comprehensive Feature Specification from Roadmap**\n\n### Concept\nThe Chaos Game Representation transforms a linear DNA sequence into a 2D fractal image encoding the complete k-mer frequency spectrum in a single visual fingerprint. Based on H. Joel Jeffrey's 1990 algorithm using an Iterated Function System (IFS):\n\n**Algorithm**: Assign nucleotides to unit square corners (A=top-left, T=top-right, G=bottom-right, C=bottom-left). Start at center. For each nucleotide, move halfway toward its corner and place a point. After k steps, point location uniquely encodes the last k nucleotides.\n\n**Biological Insights Revealed**:\n- CpG suppression (void in CG corner region - methylation signature)\n- Codon bias (highly expressed genes cluster in preferred codon regions)\n- Repetitive elements (unusually bright spots = high local k-mer frequency)\n- Horizontal gene transfer (texture discontinuities = mosaic ancestry)\n- Strand asymmetry (leading vs lagging strand preferences)\n\n### Mathematical Foundations\n\n**CGR Iteration Map**:\nGiven corners: A=(0,0), T=(1,0), C=(0,1), G=(1,1)\nStarting: P0 = (0.5, 0.5)\nFor each nucleotide ni: Pi = (Pi-1 + corner(ni)) / 2\n\n**K-mer to Coordinate Mapping (Bijective)**:\nx = sum(i=1 to k) xi / 2^i   (xi = corner_x(si))\ny = sum(i=1 to k) yi / 2^i   (yi = corner_y(si))\nEvery point in [0,1]^2 corresponds to a unique infinite k-mer.\n\n**Frequency CGR (FCGR)**:\nDiscretize unit square into 2^k x 2^k grid. Each cell counts k-mer occurrences:\n- k=3: 8x8 = 64 cells (trinucleotides)\n- k=4: 16x16 = 256 cells (tetranucleotides)\n\n**Fractal Dimension**: D2 = lim(e-\u003e0) log(C(e)) / log(e)\n- Random: D2 ~ 2 (fills plane)\n- Repetitive: D2 \u003c 2 (attractors)\n\n**Comparison Metrics**: Euclidean, Pearson correlation, KL divergence, Cosine similarity\n\n### Implementation\n\n**Core Interfaces**: CGRConfig (resolution, normalize, logScale, smoothing), CGRResult (grid: Float32Array, resolution, maxCount, totalPoints, emptyFraction, entropy)\n\n**computeCGR()**: O(n) iteration, corner lookup, grid increment, entropy calculation\n\n**compareCGR()**: Euclidean distance, Pearson correlation, cosine similarity\n\n**Braille TUI Rendering**: Unicode Braille (0x2800 base) for 8x resolution boost. Heat map coloring.\n\n**Interactive**: Zoom k-mer space, Pan, K-mer lookup, Side-by-side comparison\n\n### Assessment\n- Novelty: 9/10 - CGR + TUI + Braille + interactive zoom unprecedented\n- Pedagogical: 9/10 - IFS, bijective mappings, information theory, chaos\n- Cool Factor: 10/10 - Beautiful fractals from DNA\n\n### Files\n- packages/tui/src/components/CGRView.tsx\n- packages/core/src/analysis/cgr.ts\n- packages/core/src/analysis/cgr-compare.ts","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-12-06T23:14:47.023731-05:00","updated_at":"2025-12-07T00:03:27.025404-05:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"phage_explorer-fno","depends_on_id":"phage_explorer-54g","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-06T23:14:47.025541-05:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}

This phase bridges the gap between our SQLite-based TUI and the browser environment.\n\n## Why This Matters\nThe phage database is the core data asset. Without efficient browser access to this data, the web app cannot function. Offline support means researchers can use the app in field conditions, on planes, or anywhere without connectivity.\n\n## Strategic Approach\nWe use **sql.js** (SQLite compiled to WebAssembly) rather than a backend API because:\n1. No server infrastructure to maintain\n2. Works offline after initial load\n3. Same database file as TUI (consistency)\n4. Near-native query performance via WASM\n\n## Deliverables\n1. **sql.js Integration** - Browser adapter in `db-runtime` package\n2. **Database Build Pipeline** - Compression, optimization, manifest\n3. **IndexedDB Caching** - Store database locally for fast reload\n4. **Service Worker** - Workbox-based offline support\n5. **State Persistence** - Browser-safe Zustand hydration\n\n## Technical Details\n\n### Database Pipeline\n```\nphage.db (source) → Optimize → Brotli compress → Chunk → manifest.json\n```\n- Target compressed size: ~10-15MB (from ~50MB)\n- Brotli quality 11 for maximum compression\n\n### Caching Strategy\n1. First visit: Fetch compressed DB from CDN\n2. Decompress and initialize sql.js\n3. Cache raw DB in IndexedDB (faster than re-decompress)\n4. Subsequent visits: Load from IndexedDB\n5. Background check for updates\n\n### Service Worker Strategy\n- **App Shell**: Precached at build time\n- **Database**: StaleWhileRevalidate (use cached, update in background)\n- **WASM modules**: CacheFirst (immutable)\n- **Fonts**: CacheFirst with long TTL\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Database loads and queries work (same results as TUI)\n- [ ] Second visit uses cached database (measurable speedup)\n- [ ] Offline mode fully functional\n- [ ] State persists across sessions\n- [ ] Database update mechanism works\n- [ ] Cold start with cached DB: \u003c1s\n\n## Risks \u0026 Mitigations\n- **Risk**: sql.js performance for large queries\n  - **Mitigation**: Precompute heavy queries, use prepared statements\n- **Risk**: IndexedDB storage limits\n  - **Mitigation**: Check quota, handle gracefully, compress if needed\n- **Risk**: Safari quirks with SharedArrayBuffer\n  - **Mitigation**: Feature detect, fall back to single-threaded mode\n\n## Dependencies\n- Phase 0 must be complete (app scaffold exists)\n- Existing `phage.db` database file","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-12-07T16:56:12.864565-05:00","updated_at":"2025-12-07T17:55:13.207777-05:00","closed_at":"2025-12-07T17:55:13.207777-05:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"phage_explorer-pml","depends_on_id":"phage_explorer-87z","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-07T17:04:29.513114-05:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}

For each domain hit:\n     - E-value \u003c 1e-5 (significant)\n     - Coverage \u003e 60% of HMM model\n     - No envelope overlap with higher-scoring hits\nOutput: domain annotations with Pfam accession, name, positions, bit score\n```\n\n**Domain occurrence matrix:**\n```\nLet D = {d₁, d₂, ..., dₘ} = all detected domains\nLet P = {p₁, p₂, ..., pₙ} = all phages\n\nOccurrence matrix O[m × n]:\n  O[i,j] = count of domain dᵢ in phage pⱼ\n\nPresence/absence matrix B[m × n]:\n  B[i,j] = 1 if O[i,j] \u003e 0, else 0\n```\n\n**Domain co-occurrence (for clustering):**\n```\nJaccard similarity between domains:\n  J(dᵢ, dⱼ) = |phages with both| / |phages with either|\n\nDomains with high Jaccard often function together.\nCluster with MCL (Markov Cluster Algorithm) to find domain modules.\n```\n\n**Chord diagram layout:**\n```\nPhages arranged on circle (0 to 2π): θᵢ = 2π × i / n\nFor each shared domain connecting phages pᵢ and pⱼ:\n  Draw Bezier curve from θᵢ to θⱼ\n  Control points at circle center (creates arc shape)\nArc thickness ∝ number of shared copies or sequence identity\n```\n\n### Implementation Approach\n\n**Domain hit storage:**\n```typescript\ninterface DomainHit {\n  pfamId: string;\n  pfamName: string;\n  clanId?: string;\n  proteinId: string;\n  phageId: number;\n  start: number;\n  end: number;\n  score: number;\n  eValue: number;\n  description: string;\n}\n```\n\n**Domain sharing computation:**\n```typescript\ninterface DomainSharing {\n  domain: string;\n  phageA: number;\n  phageB: number;\n  copiesA: number;\n  copiesB: number;\n  averageIdentity: number;\n}\n\n// Find all pairwise sharings across phages\n// Group by domain family for filtering\n```\n\n**MCL clustering for domain modules:**\n```typescript\ninterface DomainCluster {\n  id: number;\n  domains: string[];\n  name: string;  // Inferred function\n  phageCount: number;\n}\n\n// Build adjacency from co-occurrence Jaccard\n// MCL iterations: expand (matrix multiply) + inflate (element-wise power)\n// Extract clusters from converged matrix\n```\n\n**ASCII Braille chord renderer:**\n```typescript\n// Braille characters give 2x4 dots per cell = high resolution curves\n// placeBraillePoint() sets individual dots in character grid\n// Bezier curves drawn point-by-point through center\n// Result: smooth arcs connecting phages on outer ring\n```\n\n### TUI Visualization\n\n```\nProtein Domain Chord Plot: Lambda + T4 + T7 + P22 + Phi29\n═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\n\n              Lambda\n                ╱╲\n              ╱    ╲\n           ⡠⠊      ⠑⡄\n         ⡰⠁          ⠑⡄\n       ⡠⠃              ⠘⡄\n      ⡜                  ⠘⡄           Selected: HTH_3 (Helix-turn-helix)\n    ⡰⠁                    ⠑⡄           Found in: Lambda (cI), P22 (c2)\n   ⡜                        ⠘⡄          Function: DNA-binding repressor\n  ⡜                          ⠘⡄\n ⡔    T4                 P22   ⠢⡀\n⡎      ⠑⢄                ⡠⠊      ⠱⡀\n⡇        ⠑⢄            ⡠⠊        ⠱⡀\n⡇          ⠑⢄        ⡠⠊          ⢱\n⡇            ⠑⢄    ⡠⠊            ⢱\n⡇              ⠑⢄⡠⠊              ⢱\n⠘⡄              ⡜               ⡰⠁\n ⠘⡄            ⡜               ⡰⠁\n  ⠘⡄          ⡜               ⡰⠁\n   ⠑⡄        ⡜              ⡰⠁\n    ⠑⡄      ⡜   Phi29     ⡠⠊\n     ⠑⡄    ⡜            ⡠⠊\n       ⠑⡄⡰⠁          ⡠⠊\n         ⠱⡀        ⡠⠊\n           T7───────⠁\n\n───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nDomain Summary:\n┌─────────────┬──────────────────────────────┬────────┬─────────────────┐\n│ Domain      │ Phages                       │ Copies │ Function        │\n├─────────────┼──────────────────────────────┼────────┼─────────────────┤\n│ Phage_cap_E │ Lambda, T4, T7, P22, Phi29   │   8    │ Capsid protein  │\n│ HTH_3       │ Lambda, P22                  │   2    │ DNA binding     │\n│ Phage_tail  │ Lambda, T4, P22              │  12    │ Tail structure  │\n│ DNA_pol_B   │ T4, T7, Phi29                │   3    │ DNA replication │\n│ Peptidase_M │ Lambda, T4, T7, P22          │   4    │ Lysis           │\n└─────────────┴──────────────────────────────┴────────┴─────────────────┘\n\nLegend: ━ Core (all phages)  ─ Common (3-4)  ╌ Rare (2)\n\n[Tab] Cycle domains  [Enter] Show alignment  [F] Filter by clan  [ESC] Exit\n```\n\n### Why This Is Good\n\n1. **Domain-level evolution**: Genes evolve, but domains are truly modular units. Domain sharing reveals deeper relationships.\n2. **Function transfer mechanism**: Which domains spread through phage populations.\n3. **Protein engineering hints**: Domain X appears with domain Y = may function together.\n4. **Beautiful data reduction**: Thousands of genes → dozens of domains → one elegant visualization.\n5. **Novel TUI visualization**: Chord diagrams in terminals are rare; Braille curves push ASCII art boundaries.\n\n### Innovation Assessment\n\n**Novelty: HIGH** - Chord diagrams exist (Circos), but no TUI implementation. ASCII/Braille curve rendering is novel. Interactive domain filtering is new.\n\n**Pedagogical Value: 9/10** - Teaches protein domains, HMM profiles, modular evolution, network visualization.\n\n**Wow Factor: 9/10** - Smooth Braille curves connecting distant phages through shared domains is visually stunning.\n\n### Data Requirements\n- HMMER + Pfam-A database for domain detection (offline preprocessing)\n- Pre-computed domain_hits table in SQLite\n- ~50MB additional data for Pfam profiles","status":"open","priority":3,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-12-06T23:20:17.342284-05:00","updated_at":"2025-12-06T23:43:59.044724-05:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"phage_explorer-ujh","depends_on_id":"phage_explorer-54g","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-06T23:20:17.344679-05:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}
