When we have multiple isolates of related phages collected over time (e.g., longitudinal coevolution studies, historical laboratory stocks), we can reconstruct **how the genome changed through time**.\n\nThis feature creates an **animated time-lapse of evolution**, showing:\n- When and where each mutation appeared\n- How **effective population size (Ne)** changed (population dynamics)\n- The **substitution rate** (molecular clock calibration)\n- Branches where lineages diverged\n\nThe key mathematical tool is the **dated phylogenetic tree** — a tree where branch lengths are calibrated to real time rather than genetic distance. Combined with ancestral sequence reconstruction, we can \"play back\" evolution.\n\n### Mathematical Foundations\n\n**Molecular Clock Hypothesis:**\n```\nSubstitutions accumulate at roughly constant rate:\n  genetic_distance ≈ μ × t × 2  (for two taxa)\nWhere:\n  μ = substitution rate (subs/site/year)\n  t = divergence time\nFor phages: μ ≈ 10⁻⁵ to 10⁻³ subs/site/year (much faster than most organisms)\n```\n\n**Root-to-tip Regression (clock test):**\n```\nFor each taxon i with sampling date tᵢ:\n  dᵢ = genetic distance from root to tip\nLinear regression: dᵢ = μ × tᵢ + c\nGood clock: R² \u003e 0.8, p \u003c 0.05\ntMRCA = -c / μ (time to most recent common ancestor)\n```\n\n**Least-Squares Dating (LSD2 algorithm):**\n```\nGiven unrooted tree T with branch lengths and tip dates {t₁...tₙ}:\nMinimize: Σᵢⱼ (dᵢⱼ - |tᵢ - tⱼ|×μ)²\nSubject to: all internal node dates \u003c descendant dates\nOutput: Dated tree with internal node dates\n```\n\n**Coalescent Skyline (Population Dynamics):**\n```\nE[waiting time for k → k-1 lineages] = Ne × 2 / (k(k-1))\nSkyline plot: Estimate Ne at each coalescent interval\nReveals population crashes (bottlenecks) and expansions\n```\n\n**Ancestral Sequence Reconstruction (Felsenstein):**\n```\nMaximum Likelihood at each internal node:\nP(node = A) = Σₓ P(left=x|node=A) × P(right=y|node=A) × P(A→x) × P(A→y)\nMarginal reconstruction: Most likely state at each position\n```\n\n### Implementation Approach\n\n**Core interfaces:**\n```typescript\ninterface DatedSequence {\n  id: string;\n  sequence: string;\n  collectionDate: Date;\n  location?: string;\n}\n\ninterface ClockAnalysis {\n  rate: number;              // subs/site/year\n  rateCI: [number, number];  // 95% CI\n  tmrca: Date;               // Time to MRCA\n  r2: number;                // Regression fit\n  clockLike: boolean;        // Is clock model appropriate?\n}\n\ninterface DatedTree {\n  tree: NewickTree;\n  nodeHeights: Map\u003cstring, number\u003e;  // Node ID -\u003e date\n  rate: number;\n}\n\ninterface AncestralReconstruction {\n  nodeSequences: Map\u003cstring, string\u003e;\n  mutations: MutationEvent[];\n  confidence: Map\u003cstring, Float32Array\u003e;\n}\n\ninterface EvolutionFrame {\n  time: number;\n  displayDate: string;\n  sequence: string;\n  mutations: { position: number; from: string; to: string }[];\n  activeBranches: string[];\n  neAtTime: number;\n  cumulativeMutations: number;\n}\n```\n\n**Animation frame generator** yields frames for smooth playback with mutations appearing at interpolated times.\n\n### TUI Visualization\n\n```\nTemporal Evolution Replay: Lambda isolates (1950-2020)\n═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\n\nTime: ████████████████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░  1985-03-12\n      1950                     2020\n\nTree (branches alive highlighted):\n                ┌──● Lambda-1950 (ancestor)\n            ┌───┤\n        ┌───┤   └──○ Lambda-1962\n    ────┤   └──────────● Lambda-1985 ← YOU ARE HERE\n        └──────────────────○ Lambda-2020 (future)\n\nSequence at 1985-03-12:\nPosition:  12450  12451  12452  12453\nAncestral:   A      T      G      C\nCurrent:     A      T      C*     C    ← MUTATION!

     // Dot-bracket notation\n  mfe: number;           // kcal/mol\n  ensembleEnergy: number;\n  basePairProbs: Float32Array;  // Upper triangular matrix\n}\n\nasync function foldRNA(\n  sequence: string,\n  temperature: number = 37\n): Promise\u003cRNAFoldResult\u003e {\n  // Call ViennaRNA RNAfold -p (partition function mode)\n  // Parse dot-bracket and probability matrix\n}\n```\n\n**Sliding window analysis:**\n```typescript\ninterface StructuralWindow {\n  start: number;\n  end: number;\n  structure: string;\n  mfe: number;\n  mfePerBase: number;  // Stability normalized by length\n  gcContent: number;\n  hairpinCount: number;\n  isPackagingCandidate: boolean;\n}\n\nfunction analyzeStructuralLandscape(\n  sequence: string,\n  windowSize: number = 200,\n  step: number = 50\n): StructuralWindow[] {\n  // Fold each window, identify stable structures\n  // Flag packaging candidates (high stability + characteristic motifs)\n}\n```\n\n**Packaging signal detection:**\n```typescript\ninterface PackagingSignal {\n  type: 'cos' | 'pac' | 'pRNA' | 'unknown';\n  position: number;\n  length: number;\n  structure: string;\n  confidence: number;\n  mechanism: string;\n}\n\nasync function detectPackagingSignals(\n  sequence: string,\n  phageFamily?: string\n): Promise\u003cPackagingSignal[]\u003e {\n  // Search for known motifs (cos cohesive ends, pac sites)\n  // Run Infernal cmsearch if available\n  // De novo detection via MFE stability peaks\n}\n```\n\n**Arc diagram renderer:**\n```typescript\nfunction renderArcDiagram(\n  structure: string,  // Dot-bracket\n  width: number\n): string[] {\n  // Parse base pairs from dot-bracket\n  // Draw arcs connecting paired positions\n  // Use Braille for smooth curves\n  // Color by pair probability or loop type\n}\n```\n\n### TUI Visualization\n\n```\nRNA Structure \u0026 Packaging Signal Explorer: Lambda phage\n═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\n\nStructural Landscape (MFE per window):\nPosition:    0kb        10kb       20kb       30kb       40kb       48kb\n             │          │          │          │          │          │\nMFE/base: ──▄▂▄▅▄▃▂▁▄▅██▅▄▃▂▁▂▃▄▅▆▅▄▃▂▁▂▃▅▆▇▅▄▃▂▁▂▃▄▅▄▃▂▁▄▅▆█▅▄──\n                       ↑                                      ↑\n                    cos site                              cos site\n                  (packaging)                           (packaging)\n\n───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nSelected Region: cos site (position 48,490-48,514)\n\nSequence:  5'-GGGCGGCGACCTCGCGGGTTTTCGC-3'\nStructure:    (((((((.....)))))))......\n              ↑     ↑     ↑\n           Stem    Loop   Stem\n                  (7 bp)\n\nArc Diagram:\n             ╭───────────────╮\n             │   ╭───────╮   │\n    G G G C G G C G A C C T C G C G G G T T T T C G C\n    │ │ │ │ │ │ │     │ │ │ │ │ │ │\n    ╰─┴─┴─┴─┴─┴─╯     ╰─┴─┴─┴─┴─┴─╯\n\nMFE: -12.3 kcal/mol\nPair probabilities: █████████░ (90% confident)\n\n───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nDetected Packaging Signals:\n┌──────────┬──────────────┬─────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│ Position │ Type         │ Description                                  │\n├──────────┼──────────────┼─────────────────────────────────────────────┤\n│   48,490 │ cos site     │ 12-bp cohesive ends, Lambda-type packaging  │\n│      1   │ cos site     │ Complementary cohesive end (circularizes)   │\n└──────────┴──────────────┴─────────────────────────────────────────────┘\n\nOther Stable Structures:\n┌──────────┬───────────────┬──────────────┬─────────────────────────────┐\n│ Position │ MFE (kcal/mol)│ Type         │ Possible Function           │\n├──────────┼───────────────┼──────────────┼─────────────────────────────┤\n│    2,340 │ -18.4         │ Hairpin      │ Transcription terminator?   │\n│    5,120 │ -15.2         │ Stem-loop    │ Ribosome binding site       │\n│   12,890 │ -22.1         │ Complex      │ Regulatory element?         │\n│   35,678 │ -19.7         │ Pseudoknot?  │ Unknown - conserved         │\n└──────────┴───────────────┴──────────────┴─────────────────────────────┘\n\n[←/→] Navigate   [Enter] Fold region   [P] Show probabilities   [ESC] Exit\n```\n\n### Why This Is Good\n\n1. **Hidden regulatory layer**: RNA structure is invisible in sequence but controls expression. This makes it visible.\n2. **Packaging mechanism insight**: cos vs pac packaging determines genome concatemers vs headful.\n3. **RNA phage essentials**: For MS2, Qβ, the genome IS the structure. Can't understand without folding.\n4. **Engineering applications**: Designing expression constructs requires understanding UTR structure.\n5. **Comparative potential**: Conserved structures across phages reveal functional constraints.\n\n### Innovation Assessment\n\n**Novelty: MEDIUM-HIGH** - RNA folding tools exist (ViennaRNA, RNAfold), but integration with genome browser, packaging signal focus, and TUI visualization are novel.\n\n**Pedagogical Value: 9/10** - Teaches RNA thermodynamics, secondary structure prediction, packaging mechanisms, translational regulation.\n\n**Wow Factor: 8/10** - Arc diagrams showing base pairs, MFE landscape plots, and packaging signal annotations make RNA structure tangible.\n\n### Data Requirements\n- ViennaRNA package (RNAfold) - external dependency\n- Optional: Infernal + Rfam covariance models for conserved structure\n- Packaging signal HMMs/patterns for known phage families","status":"open","priority":3,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-12-06T23:21:06.03497-05:00","updated_at":"2025-12-06T23:47:10.804431-05:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"phage_explorer-474","depends_on_id":"phage_explorer-54g","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-06T23:21:06.039512-05:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}

Some interfere through:\n- **Superinfection exclusion (Sie)**: One phage blocks another from entering\n- **Receptor competition**: Both need same receptor (one wins)\n- **Lysis timing conflicts**: Different burst schedules cause resource waste\n- **Immunity/Lysogeny**: Temperate phage provides immunity against related phages\n\nThis feature computes a **compatibility matrix** across all phages and solves the **optimal cocktail selection problem**: find the minimal set covering target host range with no compatibility conflicts.\n\n### Mathematical Foundations\n\n**Compatibility scoring:**\n```\nFor phages A and B, compatibility score C(A,B) ∈ [-1, +1]:\n\nPositive factors (synergy):\n  - Different receptors: +0.3\n  - Different lysis timing (early + late): +0.2\n  - Complementary host ranges: +0.3\n  - No sequence homology in immunity regions: +0.2\n\nNegative factors (interference):\n  - Same receptor: -0.4\n  - Superinfection exclusion genes detected: -0.5\n  - Similar lysis timing: -0.2\n  - Sie genes present in both: -0.3\n  - One temperate provides immunity to other: -0.8\n\nC(A,B) = Σ positive_factors - Σ negative_factors (clamped to [-1, +1])\n```\n\n**Host range coverage:**\n```\nLet H = {h₁, h₂, ..., hₘ} = target hosts\nLet P = {p₁, p₂, ..., pₙ} = candidate phages\nLet R[i,j] = 1 if phage pᵢ infects host hⱼ, else 0\n\nCoverage of subset S ⊆ P:\n  Cov(S) = { hⱼ : ∃ pᵢ ∈ S with R[i,j] = 1 }\n```\n\n**Optimal cocktail as Set Cover + Compatibility (NP-hard):**\n```\nMaximize: |Cov(S)| (hosts covered)\nSubject to:\n  |S| ≤ k (max cocktail size, typically 3-5)\n  ∀ pᵢ, pⱼ ∈ S: C(pᵢ, pⱼ) \u003e threshold (no conflicts)\n\nSolutions:\n  - Greedy: Add phage with best coverage/compatibility ratio\n  - ILP: Optimal but slower\n  - Genetic algorithm: For large phage libraries\n```\n\n**ILP formulation:**\n```\nVariables:\n  xᵢ ∈ {0,1} = 1 if phage i selected\n  yⱼ ∈ {0,1} = 1 if host j covered\n\nMaximize: Σⱼ yⱼ\nSubject to:\n  Σᵢ xᵢ ≤ k                           (cocktail size limit)\n  yⱼ ≤ Σᵢ R[i,j] × xᵢ                 (coverage constraint)\n  xᵢ + xⱼ ≤ 1 for incompatible pairs  (compatibility constraint)\n```\n\n### Implementation Approach\n\n**Feature extraction for compatibility:**\n```typescript\ninterface PhageInterferenceFeatures {\n  phageId: number;\n  receptorGenes: string[];          // e.g., ['OmpC', 'LamB']\n  sieGenes: string[];               // Superinfection exclusion\n  lysisTime: 'early' | 'middle' | 'late';\n  lifecycle: 'lytic' | 'temperate';\n  immunityRegion?: string;          // For temperate phages\n  hostRange: Set\u003cstring\u003e;           // Confirmed hosts\n}\n```\n\n**Pairwise compatibility calculation:**\n```typescript\ninterface CompatibilityScore {\n  phageA: number;\n  phageB: number;\n  score: number;  // -1 to +1\n  factors: { name: string; contribution: number; reason: string }[];\n  compatible: boolean;  // score \u003e threshold\n}\n\n// Compute receptor overlap, Sie presence, lysis timing,\n// immunity cross-reaction, host range complementarity\n```\n\n**Optimal cocktail solver (greedy):**\n```typescript\ninterface CocktailSolution {\n  phages: number[];\n  coverage: string[];  // Hosts covered\n  coveragePercent: number;\n  compatibilityScore: number;  // Average pairwise score\n  rationale: string[];\n}\n\n// While selected.length \u003c maxSize and covered.size \u003c targetHosts.length:\n//   Find best phage (compatible + max marginal coverage)\n//   Add to selection, update covered set\n```\n\n### TUI Visualization\n\n```\nPhage Cocktail Compatibility Matrix\n═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\n\nCompatibility Heatmap (12 phages):\n          │ λ   T4  T7  P22 M13 Mu  Φ29 Φ6  T5  SPβ HK97 P1  │\n──────────┼─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤\nLambda    │ ·   +0.6 +0.4 -0.3 +0.8 +0.2 +0.5 +0.7 +0.1 -0.7 +0.3 +0.4 │\nT4        │     ·    +0.5 +0.6 +0.7 +0.3 +0.4 +0.8 +0.6 +0.4 +0.5 +0.5 │\nT7        │          ·    +0.5 +0.6 +0.4 +0.8 +0.7 +0.3 +0.3 +0.4 +0.5 │\nP22       │               ·    +0.5 -0.2 +0.3 +0.6 +0.4 +0.5 -0.4 +0.3 │\n...       │                                                             │\n──────────┴─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\n\nLegend: ▓▓▓ +0.8 ▒▒▒ +0.4 ░░░ 0.0 ··· -0.4 ▫▫▫ -0.8\n\n⚠ Incompatible pairs:\n  Lambda × SPbeta (-0.7): Cross-immunity (temperate, 78% identity)\n  Lambda × P22 (-0.3): Same receptor (LamB)\n\n───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nCOCKTAIL OPTIMIZER\n\nTarget hosts: E. coli K-12, B, C; Salmonella; P. aeruginosa (5 total)\n\n✓ RECOMMENDED COCKTAIL:\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│  1.

This provides quantitative guidance.\n2. **Resistance prevention**: Cocktails are essential but bad combinations are worse than single phages.\n3. **Scalable optimization**: As phage libraries grow (thousands), manual selection becomes impossible.\n4. **Explainable recommendations**: Not just \"use these\" but \"because X covers Y, and Z adds receptor diversity.\"\n5. **Novel contribution**: No existing tool combines compatibility scoring with coverage optimization.\n\n### Innovation Assessment\n\n**Novelty: VERY HIGH** - First computational compatibility predictor for phages. First cocktail optimization solver. Novel integration of molecular interference mechanisms.\n\n**Pedagogical Value: 9/10** - Teaches Sie, receptor competition, immunity, combinatorial optimization (set cover, ILP, greedy), therapy design principles.\n\n**Wow Factor: 9/10** - Heatmap with green (compatible) and red (incompatible) is immediately intuitive. Watching algorithm select optimal cocktail with rationale feels like having an expert consultant.\n\n### Data Requirements\n- Phage interference features (receptors, Sie genes, lysis timing)\n- Host range data (which phages infect which hosts)\n- Immunity region sequences (for temperate phages)","status":"open","priority":3,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-12-06T23:20:17.845538-05:00","updated_at":"2025-12-06T23:46:06.517103-05:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"phage_explorer-4ty","depends_on_id":"phage_explorer-54g","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-06T23:20:17.848483-05:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}

Novelty: 9/10, Pedagogical: 9/10, Cool Factor: 10/10.","notes":"## CHAOS GAME REPRESENTATION (CGR) FRACTAL FINGERPRINTS\n\n**Comprehensive Feature Specification from Roadmap**\n\n### Concept\nThe Chaos Game Representation transforms a linear DNA sequence into a 2D fractal image encoding the complete k-mer frequency spectrum in a single visual fingerprint. Based on H. Joel Jeffrey's 1990 algorithm using an Iterated Function System (IFS):\n\n**Algorithm**: Assign nucleotides to unit square corners (A=top-left, T=top-right, G=bottom-right, C=bottom-left). Start at center. For each nucleotide, move halfway toward its corner and place a point. After k steps, point location uniquely encodes the last k nucleotides.\n\n**Biological Insights Revealed**:\n- CpG suppression (void in CG corner region - methylation signature)\n- Codon bias (highly expressed genes cluster in preferred codon regions)\n- Repetitive elements (unusually bright spots = high local k-mer frequency)\n- Horizontal gene transfer (texture discontinuities = mosaic ancestry)\n- Strand asymmetry (leading vs lagging strand preferences)\n\n### Mathematical Foundations\n\n**CGR Iteration Map**:\nGiven corners: A=(0,0), T=(1,0), C=(0,1), G=(1,1)\nStarting: P0 = (0.5, 0.5)\nFor each nucleotide ni: Pi = (Pi-1 + corner(ni)) / 2\n\n**K-mer to Coordinate Mapping (Bijective)**:\nx = sum(i=1 to k) xi / 2^i   (xi = corner_x(si))\ny = sum(i=1 to k) yi / 2^i   (yi = corner_y(si))\nEvery point in [0,1]^2 corresponds to a unique infinite k-mer.\n\n**Frequency CGR (FCGR)**:\nDiscretize unit square into 2^k x 2^k grid. Each cell counts k-mer occurrences:\n- k=3: 8x8 = 64 cells (trinucleotides)\n- k=4: 16x16 = 256 cells (tetranucleotides)\n\n**Fractal Dimension**: D2 = lim(e-\u003e0) log(C(e)) / log(e)\n- Random: D2 ~ 2 (fills plane)\n- Repetitive: D2 \u003c 2 (attractors)\n\n**Comparison Metrics**: Euclidean, Pearson correlation, KL divergence, Cosine similarity\n\n### Implementation\n\n**Core Interfaces**: CGRConfig (resolution, normalize, logScale, smoothing), CGRResult (grid: Float32Array, resolution, maxCount, totalPoints, emptyFraction, entropy)\n\n**computeCGR()**: O(n) iteration, corner lookup, grid increment, entropy calculation\n\n**compareCGR()**: Euclidean distance, Pearson correlation, cosine similarity\n\n**Braille TUI Rendering**: Unicode Braille (0x2800 base) for 8x resolution boost. Heat map coloring.\n\n**Interactive**: Zoom k-mer space, Pan, K-mer lookup, Side-by-side comparison\n\n### Assessment\n- Novelty: 9/10 - CGR + TUI + Braille + interactive zoom unprecedented\n- Pedagogical: 9/10 - IFS, bijective mappings, information theory, chaos\n- Cool Factor: 10/10 - Beautiful fractals from DNA\n\n### Files\n- packages/tui/src/components/CGRView.tsx\n- packages/core/src/analysis/cgr.ts\n- packages/core/src/analysis/cgr-compare.ts","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-12-06T23:14:47.023731-05:00","updated_at":"2025-12-07T00:03:27.025404-05:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"phage_explorer-fno","depends_on_id":"phage_explorer-54g","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-06T23:14:47.025541-05:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}

For each domain hit:\n     - E-value \u003c 1e-5 (significant)\n     - Coverage \u003e 60% of HMM model\n     - No envelope overlap with higher-scoring hits\nOutput: domain annotations with Pfam accession, name, positions, bit score\n```\n\n**Domain occurrence matrix:**\n```\nLet D = {d₁, d₂, ..., dₘ} = all detected domains\nLet P = {p₁, p₂, ..., pₙ} = all phages\n\nOccurrence matrix O[m × n]:\n  O[i,j] = count of domain dᵢ in phage pⱼ\n\nPresence/absence matrix B[m × n]:\n  B[i,j] = 1 if O[i,j] \u003e 0, else 0\n```\n\n**Domain co-occurrence (for clustering):**\n```\nJaccard similarity between domains:\n  J(dᵢ, dⱼ) = |phages with both| / |phages with either|\n\nDomains with high Jaccard often function together.\nCluster with MCL (Markov Cluster Algorithm) to find domain modules.\n```\n\n**Chord diagram layout:**\n```\nPhages arranged on circle (0 to 2π): θᵢ = 2π × i / n\nFor each shared domain connecting phages pᵢ and pⱼ:\n  Draw Bezier curve from θᵢ to θⱼ\n  Control points at circle center (creates arc shape)\nArc thickness ∝ number of shared copies or sequence identity\n```\n\n### Implementation Approach\n\n**Domain hit storage:**\n```typescript\ninterface DomainHit {\n  pfamId: string;\n  pfamName: string;\n  clanId?: string;\n  proteinId: string;\n  phageId: number;\n  start: number;\n  end: number;\n  score: number;\n  eValue: number;\n  description: string;\n}\n```\n\n**Domain sharing computation:**\n```typescript\ninterface DomainSharing {\n  domain: string;\n  phageA: number;\n  phageB: number;\n  copiesA: number;\n  copiesB: number;\n  averageIdentity: number;\n}\n\n// Find all pairwise sharings across phages\n// Group by domain family for filtering\n```\n\n**MCL clustering for domain modules:**\n```typescript\ninterface DomainCluster {\n  id: number;\n  domains: string[];\n  name: string;  // Inferred function\n  phageCount: number;\n}\n\n// Build adjacency from co-occurrence Jaccard\n// MCL iterations: expand (matrix multiply) + inflate (element-wise power)\n// Extract clusters from converged matrix\n```\n\n**ASCII Braille chord renderer:**\n```typescript\n// Braille characters give 2x4 dots per cell = high resolution curves\n// placeBraillePoint() sets individual dots in character grid\n// Bezier curves drawn point-by-point through center\n// Result: smooth arcs connecting phages on outer ring\n```\n\n### TUI Visualization\n\n```\nProtein Domain Chord Plot: Lambda + T4 + T7 + P22 + Phi29\n═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\n\n              Lambda\n                ╱╲\n              ╱    ╲\n           ⡠⠊      ⠑⡄\n         ⡰⠁          ⠑⡄\n       ⡠⠃              ⠘⡄\n      ⡜                  ⠘⡄           Selected: HTH_3 (Helix-turn-helix)\n    ⡰⠁                    ⠑⡄           Found in: Lambda (cI), P22 (c2)\n   ⡜                        ⠘⡄          Function: DNA-binding repressor\n  ⡜                          ⠘⡄\n ⡔    T4                 P22   ⠢⡀\n⡎      ⠑⢄                ⡠⠊      ⠱⡀\n⡇        ⠑⢄            ⡠⠊        ⠱⡀\n⡇          ⠑⢄        ⡠⠊          ⢱\n⡇            ⠑⢄    ⡠⠊            ⢱\n⡇              ⠑⢄⡠⠊              ⢱\n⠘⡄              ⡜               ⡰⠁\n ⠘⡄            ⡜               ⡰⠁\n  ⠘⡄          ⡜               ⡰⠁\n   ⠑⡄        ⡜              ⡰⠁\n    ⠑⡄      ⡜   Phi29     ⡠⠊\n     ⠑⡄    ⡜            ⡠⠊\n       ⠑⡄⡰⠁          ⡠⠊\n         ⠱⡀        ⡠⠊\n           T7───────⠁\n\n───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nDomain Summary:\n┌─────────────┬──────────────────────────────┬────────┬─────────────────┐\n│ Domain      │ Phages                       │ Copies │ Function        │\n├─────────────┼──────────────────────────────┼────────┼─────────────────┤\n│ Phage_cap_E │ Lambda, T4, T7, P22, Phi29   │   8    │ Capsid protein  │\n│ HTH_3       │ Lambda, P22                  │   2    │ DNA binding     │\n│ Phage_tail  │ Lambda, T4, P22              │  12    │ Tail structure  │\n│ DNA_pol_B   │ T4, T7, Phi29                │   3    │ DNA replication │\n│ Peptidase_M │ Lambda, T4, T7, P22          │   4    │ Lysis           │\n└─────────────┴──────────────────────────────┴────────┴─────────────────┘\n\nLegend: ━ Core (all phages)  ─ Common (3-4)  ╌ Rare (2)\n\n[Tab] Cycle domains  [Enter] Show alignment  [F] Filter by clan  [ESC] Exit\n```\n\n### Why This Is Good\n\n1. **Domain-level evolution**: Genes evolve, but domains are truly modular units. Domain sharing reveals deeper relationships.\n2. **Function transfer mechanism**: Which domains spread through phage populations.\n3. **Protein engineering hints**: Domain X appears with domain Y = may function together.\n4. **Beautiful data reduction**: Thousands of genes → dozens of domains → one elegant visualization.\n5. **Novel TUI visualization**: Chord diagrams in terminals are rare; Braille curves push ASCII art boundaries.\n\n### Innovation Assessment\n\n**Novelty: HIGH** - Chord diagrams exist (Circos), but no TUI implementation. ASCII/Braille curve rendering is novel. Interactive domain filtering is new.\n\n**Pedagogical Value: 9/10** - Teaches protein domains, HMM profiles, modular evolution, network visualization.\n\n**Wow Factor: 9/10** - Smooth Braille curves connecting distant phages through shared domains is visually stunning.\n\n### Data Requirements\n- HMMER + Pfam-A database for domain detection (offline preprocessing)\n- Pre-computed domain_hits table in SQLite\n- ~50MB additional data for Pfam profiles","status":"open","priority":3,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-12-06T23:20:17.342284-05:00","updated_at":"2025-12-06T23:43:59.044724-05:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"phage_explorer-ujh","depends_on_id":"phage_explorer-54g","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-06T23:20:17.344679-05:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}
