When we have multiple isolates of related phages collected over time (e.g., longitudinal coevolution studies, historical laboratory stocks), we can reconstruct **how the genome changed through time**.\n\nThis feature creates an **animated time-lapse of evolution**, showing:\n- When and where each mutation appeared\n- How **effective population size (Ne)** changed (population dynamics)\n- The **substitution rate** (molecular clock calibration)\n- Branches where lineages diverged\n\nThe key mathematical tool is the **dated phylogenetic tree** — a tree where branch lengths are calibrated to real time rather than genetic distance. Combined with ancestral sequence reconstruction, we can \"play back\" evolution.\n\n### Mathematical Foundations\n\n**Molecular Clock Hypothesis:**\n```\nSubstitutions accumulate at roughly constant rate:\n  genetic_distance ≈ μ × t × 2  (for two taxa)\nWhere:\n  μ = substitution rate (subs/site/year)\n  t = divergence time\nFor phages: μ ≈ 10⁻⁵ to 10⁻³ subs/site/year (much faster than most organisms)\n```\n\n**Root-to-tip Regression (clock test):**\n```\nFor each taxon i with sampling date tᵢ:\n  dᵢ = genetic distance from root to tip\nLinear regression: dᵢ = μ × tᵢ + c\nGood clock: R² \u003e 0.8, p \u003c 0.05\ntMRCA = -c / μ (time to most recent common ancestor)\n```\n\n**Least-Squares Dating (LSD2 algorithm):**\n```\nGiven unrooted tree T with branch lengths and tip dates {t₁...tₙ}:\nMinimize: Σᵢⱼ (dᵢⱼ - |tᵢ - tⱼ|×μ)²\nSubject to: all internal node dates \u003c descendant dates\nOutput: Dated tree with internal node dates\n```\n\n**Coalescent Skyline (Population Dynamics):**\n```\nE[waiting time for k → k-1 lineages] = Ne × 2 / (k(k-1))\nSkyline plot: Estimate Ne at each coalescent interval\nReveals population crashes (bottlenecks) and expansions\n```\n\n**Ancestral Sequence Reconstruction (Felsenstein):**\n```\nMaximum Likelihood at each internal node:\nP(node = A) = Σₓ P(left=x|node=A) × P(right=y|node=A) × P(A→x) × P(A→y)\nMarginal reconstruction: Most likely state at each position\n```\n\n### Implementation Approach\n\n**Core interfaces:**\n```typescript\ninterface DatedSequence {\n  id: string;\n  sequence: string;\n  collectionDate: Date;\n  location?: string;\n}\n\ninterface ClockAnalysis {\n  rate: number;              // subs/site/year\n  rateCI: [number, number];  // 95% CI\n  tmrca: Date;               // Time to MRCA\n  r2: number;                // Regression fit\n  clockLike: boolean;        // Is clock model appropriate?\n}\n\ninterface DatedTree {\n  tree: NewickTree;\n  nodeHeights: Map\u003cstring, number\u003e;  // Node ID -\u003e date\n  rate: number;\n}\n\ninterface AncestralReconstruction {\n  nodeSequences: Map\u003cstring, string\u003e;\n  mutations: MutationEvent[];\n  confidence: Map\u003cstring, Float32Array\u003e;\n}\n\ninterface EvolutionFrame {\n  time: number;\n  displayDate: string;\n  sequence: string;\n  mutations: { position: number; from: string; to: string }[];\n  activeBranches: string[];\n  neAtTime: number;\n  cumulativeMutations: number;\n}\n```\n\n**Animation frame generator** yields frames for smooth playback with mutations appearing at interpolated times.\n\n### TUI Visualization\n\n```\nTemporal Evolution Replay: Lambda isolates (1950-2020)\n═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\n\nTime: ████████████████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░  1985-03-12\n      1950                     2020\n\nTree (branches alive highlighted):\n                ┌──● Lambda-1950 (ancestor)\n            ┌───┤\n        ┌───┤   └──○ Lambda-1962\n    ────┤   └──────────● Lambda-1985 ← YOU ARE HERE\n        └──────────────────○ Lambda-2020 (future)\n\nSequence at 1985-03-12:\nPosition:  12450  12451  12452  12453\nAncestral:   A      T      G      C\nCurrent:     A      T      C*     C    ← MUTATION!

Animation reveals dynamics.\n3. **Outbreak forensics**: For phage therapy monitoring, knowing *when* resistance arose helps understand failures.\n4. **Educational power**: Nothing conveys \"evolution is ongoing\" like watching mutations accumulate.\n5. **Population dynamics**: Ne skyline reveals bottlenecks and expansions — demographic history of the phage.\n\n### Innovation Assessment\n\n**Novelty: HIGH** - Time-tree tools exist (BEAST, TreeTime, LSD2), but no interactive animated TUI visualization. \"Time scrubber\" interface is completely novel.\n\n**Pedagogical Value: 10/10** - Teaches molecular clocks, phylogenetic dating, coalescent theory, ancestral reconstruction, population dynamics.\n\n**Wow Factor: 10/10** - Watching mutations appear one by one as timeline advances — seeing the \"ghost\" of ancestral sequence transform into modern isolate — is genuinely mesmerizing.\n\n### Data Requirements\n- Multiple dated isolate sequences (FASTA + dates)\n- At least 5-10 isolates spanning time range\n- Good temporal signal (clock-like evolution)","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-12-06T23:17:53.647084-05:00","updated_at":"2025-12-07T13:42:40.50014-05:00","closed_at":"2025-12-07T13:42:40.50014-05:00","source_repo":".","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"phage_explorer-0k6","depends_on_id":"phage_explorer-ojb","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-06T23:17:53.649358-05:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}

Cover diverse host strains\n2. Prevent resistance emergence\n3. Ensure redundant killing mechanisms\n\nBut not all phages work together. Some interfere through:\n- **Superinfection exclusion (Sie)**: One phage blocks another from entering\n- **Receptor competition**: Both need same receptor (one wins)\n- **Lysis timing conflicts**: Different burst schedules cause resource waste\n- **Immunity/Lysogeny**: Temperate phage provides immunity against related phages\n\nThis feature computes a **compatibility matrix** across all phages and solves the **optimal cocktail selection problem**: find the minimal set covering target host range with no compatibility conflicts.\n\n### Mathematical Foundations\n\n**Compatibility scoring:**\n```\nFor phages A and B, compatibility score C(A,B) ∈ [-1, +1]:\n\nPositive factors (synergy):\n  - Different receptors: +0.3\n  - Different lysis timing (early + late): +0.2\n  - Complementary host ranges: +0.3\n  - No sequence homology in immunity regions: +0.2\n\nNegative factors (interference):\n  - Same receptor: -0.4\n  - Superinfection exclusion genes detected: -0.5\n  - Similar lysis timing: -0.2\n  - Sie genes present in both: -0.3\n  - One temperate provides immunity to other: -0.8\n\nC(A,B) = Σ positive_factors - Σ negative_factors (clamped to [-1, +1])\n```\n\n**Host range coverage:**\n```\nLet H = {h₁, h₂, ..., hₘ} = target hosts\nLet P = {p₁, p₂, ..., pₙ} = candidate phages\nLet R[i,j] = 1 if phage pᵢ infects host hⱼ, else 0\n\nCoverage of subset S ⊆ P:\n  Cov(S) = { hⱼ : ∃ pᵢ ∈ S with R[i,j] = 1 }\n```\n\n**Optimal cocktail as Set Cover + Compatibility (NP-hard):**\n```\nMaximize: |Cov(S)| (hosts covered)\nSubject to:\n  |S| ≤ k (max cocktail size, typically 3-5)\n  ∀ pᵢ, pⱼ ∈ S: C(pᵢ, pⱼ) \u003e threshold (no conflicts)\n\nSolutions:\n  - Greedy: Add phage with best coverage/compatibility ratio\n  - ILP: Optimal but slower\n  - Genetic algorithm: For large phage libraries\n```\n\n**ILP formulation:**\n```\nVariables:\n  xᵢ ∈ {0,1} = 1 if phage i selected\n  yⱼ ∈ {0,1} = 1 if host j covered\n\nMaximize: Σⱼ yⱼ\nSubject to:\n  Σᵢ xᵢ ≤ k                           (cocktail size limit)\n  yⱼ ≤ Σᵢ R[i,j] × xᵢ                 (coverage constraint)\n  xᵢ + xⱼ ≤ 1 for incompatible pairs  (compatibility constraint)\n```\n\n### Implementation Approach\n\n**Feature extraction for compatibility:**\n```typescript\ninterface PhageInterferenceFeatures {\n  phageId: number;\n  receptorGenes: string[];          // e.g., ['OmpC', 'LamB']\n  sieGenes: string[];               // Superinfection exclusion\n  lysisTime: 'early' | 'middle' | 'late';\n  lifecycle: 'lytic' | 'temperate';\n  immunityRegion?: string;          // For temperate phages\n  hostRange: Set\u003cstring\u003e;           // Confirmed hosts\n}\n```\n\n**Pairwise compatibility calculation:**\n```typescript\ninterface CompatibilityScore {\n  phageA: number;\n  phageB: number;\n  score: number;  // -1 to +1\n  factors: { name: string; contribution: number; reason: string }[];\n  compatible: boolean;  // score \u003e threshold\n}\n\n// Compute receptor overlap, Sie presence, lysis timing,\n// immunity cross-reaction, host range complementarity\n```\n\n**Optimal cocktail solver (greedy):**\n```typescript\ninterface CocktailSolution {\n  phages: number[];\n  coverage: string[];  // Hosts covered\n  coveragePercent: number;\n  compatibilityScore: number;  // Average pairwise score\n  rationale: string[];\n}\n\n// While selected.length \u003c maxSize and covered.size \u003c targetHosts.length:\n//   Find best phage (compatible + max marginal coverage)\n//   Add to selection, update covered set\n```\n\n### TUI Visualization\n\n```\nPhage Cocktail Compatibility Matrix\n═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\n\nCompatibility Heatmap (12 phages):\n          │ λ   T4  T7  P22 M13 Mu  Φ29 Φ6  T5  SPβ HK97 P1  │\n──────────┼─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤\nLambda    │ ·   +0.6 +0.4 -0.3 +0.8 +0.2 +0.5 +0.7 +0.1 -0.7 +0.3 +0.4 │\nT4        │     ·    +0.5 +0.6 +0.7 +0.3 +0.4 +0.8 +0.6 +0.4 +0.5 +0.5 │\nT7        │          ·    +0.5 +0.6 +0.4 +0.8 +0.7 +0.3 +0.3 +0.4 +0.5 │\nP22       │               ·    +0.5 -0.2 +0.3 +0.6 +0.4 +0.5 -0.4 +0.3 │\n...       │                                                             │\n──────────┴─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\n\nLegend: ▓▓▓ +0.8 ▒▒▒ +0.4 ░░░ 0.0 ··· -0.4 ▫▫▫ -0.8\n\n⚠ Incompatible pairs:\n  Lambda × SPbeta (-0.7): Cross-immunity (temperate, 78% identity)\n  Lambda × P22 (-0.3): Same receptor (LamB)\n\n───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nCOCKTAIL OPTIMIZER\n\nTarget hosts: E. coli K-12, B, C; Salmonella; P. aeruginosa (5 total)\n\n✓ RECOMMENDED COCKTAIL:\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│  1.

This provides quantitative guidance.\n2. **Resistance prevention**: Cocktails are essential but bad combinations are worse than single phages.\n3. **Scalable optimization**: As phage libraries grow (thousands), manual selection becomes impossible.\n4. **Explainable recommendations**: Not just \"use these\" but \"because X covers Y, and Z adds receptor diversity.\"\n5. **Novel contribution**: No existing tool combines compatibility scoring with coverage optimization.\n\n### Innovation Assessment\n\n**Novelty: VERY HIGH** - First computational compatibility predictor for phages. First cocktail optimization solver. Novel integration of molecular interference mechanisms.\n\n**Pedagogical Value: 9/10** - Teaches Sie, receptor competition, immunity, combinatorial optimization (set cover, ILP, greedy), therapy design principles.\n\n**Wow Factor: 9/10** - Heatmap with green (compatible) and red (incompatible) is immediately intuitive. Watching algorithm select optimal cocktail with rationale feels like having an expert consultant.\n\n### Data Requirements\n- Phage interference features (receptors, Sie genes, lysis timing)\n- Host range data (which phages infect which hosts)\n- Immunity region sequences (for temperate phages)","status":"open","priority":3,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-12-06T23:20:17.845538-05:00","updated_at":"2025-12-06T23:46:06.517103-05:00","source_repo":".","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"phage_explorer-4ty","depends_on_id":"phage_explorer-54g","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-06T23:20:17.848483-05:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}

Fix GlyphAtlas to render micro-text at small sizes (4-8px)\n2. Implement smart zoom presets with semantic labels\n3. Add dual-row DNA+AA rendering mode\n4. Implement orientation change detection and grid reflow\n5. Improve touch scroll momentum and inertia\n6. Add tap-to-select position\n7.

This makes the sequence grid useless for reading on mobile at moderate zoom levels.\n\n## Solution\nCreate optimized micro-text rendering for 4-8px cell widths using:\n\n1. **Pixel-perfect bitmap fonts**: Pre-render 4x6 and 5x7 pixel bitmap fonts for nucleotides (A,T,G,C,N) and amino acids (20 letters)\n\n2. **Subpixel rendering**: Use LCD subpixel rendering on capable displays for effective 3x resolution horizontally\n\n3. **Contrast optimization**: Use maximum contrast colors (pure white on colored background) for micro-text\n\n4. **Glyph caching**: Pre-render all glyphs to OffscreenCanvas atlas at multiple sizes\n\n## Technical Approach\n\n```typescript\n// In GlyphAtlas.ts\ninterface MicroGlyphConfig {\n  charWidth: 4 | 5 | 6;  // pixels\n  charHeight: 6 | 7 | 8; // pixels\n  subpixelRendering: boolean;\n}\n\n// Bitmap font data for 4x6 nucleotides\nconst MICRO_FONT_4x6: Record\u003cNucleotide, number[]\u003e = {\n  A: [0b0110, 0b1001, 0b1111, 0b1001, 0b1001, 0b0000],\n  T: [0b1111, 0b0100, 0b0100, 0b0100, 0b0100, 0b0000],\n  G: [0b0111, 0b1000, 0b1011, 0b1001, 0b0111, 0b0000],\n  C: [0b0111, 0b1000, 0b1000, 0b1000, 0b0111, 0b0000],\n  N: [0b1001, 0b1101, 0b1011, 0b1001, 0b1001, 0b0000],\n};\n```\n\n## Files to Modify\n\n- `/packages/web/src/rendering/GlyphAtlas.ts`\n  - Add `renderMicroGlyph(char, cellWidth, cellHeight)` method\n  - Add bitmap font data constants\n  - Add subpixel rendering path\n  - Update `drawNucleotide` and `drawAminoAcid` to use micro glyphs when appropriate\n\n## Testing\n\n1. Visual test at 4px, 5px, 6px, 7px, 8px cell widths\n2. Verify readability on Retina and non-Retina displays\n3. Performance test: render 10,000 cells at 60fps\n4. Color contrast verification for accessibility\n\n## Considerations\n\n- **Memory**: Bitmap fonts are tiny (\u003c1KB per size)\n- **Fallback**: If micro-text not available, show colored blocks (current behavior)\n- **DPI scaling**: Multiply dimensions by devicePixelRatio\n","status":"in_progress","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-09T00:35:11.947731-05:00","updated_at":"2025-12-09T00:43:35.291065-05:00","source_repo":".","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"phage_explorer-5yu6","depends_on_id":"phage_explorer-5ozb","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-09T00:40:29.839747-05:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}

This is the critical path - nothing else can proceed until these components are in place.\n\n## Why This Phase is First\n\nThe web app currently has:\n- A static landing page App.tsx (just marketing content)\n- No connection to the phage database\n- No integration with the shared @phage-explorer/state store\n\nWithout database access and proper state management, we cannot display phages, sequences, or any analysis results.\n\n## Technical Components\n\n### 1. WebPhageRepository (Critical)\n\n**What**: Implementation of the `PhageRepository` interface using sql.js\n\n**Why sql.js**: \n- Browser-native SQLite via WebAssembly\n- Single source of truth (same DB as TUI)\n- No backend server required\n- Works offline once cached\n\n**Interface to implement**:\n- `listPhages(): Promise\u003cPhageSummary[]\u003e`\n- `getPhageByIndex(index: number): Promise\u003cPhageFull | null\u003e`\n- `getSequenceWindow(phageId, start, end): Promise\u003cstring\u003e`\n- `searchPhages(query: string): Promise\u003cPhageSummary[]\u003e`\n\n### 2. State Integration\n\n**What**: Connect @phage-explorer/state Zustand store to React components\n\n**Current state**: Web has its own `useWebPreferences` store but doesn't use the shared store\n\n**Goal**: Unified state management matching TUI behavior\n\n### 3. App.tsx Rewrite\n\n**What**: Transform from static landing page to full application shell\n\n**Must include**:\n- useDatabase() hook for DB lifecycle\n- Loading states with progress indicator\n- Error boundary for DB failures\n- Proper component layout (PhageList, SequenceGrid, GeneMap)\n- Keyboard manager integration\n- Overlay system wiring\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- **Blocks**: All other phases (nothing works without this)\n- **Depends on**: None (pure foundation work)\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n- [ ] Database loads in browser with progress indicator\n- [ ] PhageRepository methods return correct data\n- [ ] Zustand store updates propagate to components\n- [ ] App.tsx renders proper layout (not landing page)\n- [ ] Keyboard events are captured\n\n## Files to Create/Modify\n\n```\npackages/web/src/\n├── data/\n│   ├── WebPhageRepository.ts    # NEW\n│   └── initDatabase.ts          # NEW\n├── App.tsx                      # REWRITE\n└── main.tsx                     # Minor updates\n```\n\n## Estimated Complexity: Medium\n\nThis phase is well-defined but critical.

This phase creates the scaffolding that all subsequent phases will build upon.\n\n## Why This Matters\nA solid foundation prevents rework later. By establishing the package structure, build tooling, theme system, and keyboard handling first, all subsequent development follows consistent patterns and shares common infrastructure.\n\n## Deliverables\n1. **Package Scaffold** - `packages/web` with Vite + React 19\n2. **Path Aliases** - Configured imports for `@phage-explorer/*` shared packages\n3. **Layout Shell** - Header, Main content area, Footer components\n4. **Theme System** - Full port of TUI themes with CSS variables\n5. **Keyboard Manager** - Hotkey registration, vim-style modal support\n6. **CSS Foundation** - Reset, typography, base variables\n\n## Technical Decisions\n- **Vite over Next.js**: No SSR needed, Vite is faster and simpler\n- **React 19**: Concurrent features for smooth updates\n- **CSS Modules + Variables**: Scoped styles, zero runtime, theme tokens\n- **No UI library**: Custom primitives for maximum control over cyberpunk aesthetic\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] App boots in browser without errors\n- [ ] Theme switching works (all 10 themes from TUI)\n- [ ] Basic keyboard shortcuts respond (arrow keys, Escape, ?)\n- [ ] Build produces optimized bundle (\u003c200KB initial)\n- [ ] TypeScript compilation passes with strict mode\n- [ ] Shared packages (@core, @state) import correctly\n\n## Risks \u0026 Mitigations\n- **Risk**: Path alias resolution issues with Vite\n  - **Mitigation**: Test imports early, configure tsconfig.json properly\n- **Risk**: Theme token explosion\n  - **Mitigation**: Use semantic tokens mapped to theme palettes\n\n## Dependencies\n- Existing `@phage-explorer/core` package\n- Existing `@phage-explorer/state` package\n\n## Implementation Notes\nThe keyboard manager should support vim-style modal patterns (NORMAL, SEARCH, COMMAND, VISUAL modes) from day one.

The 3D viewer does not properly auto-fit molecules to the viewport.\n\n**What should happen:** When a 3D structure loads, the camera should automatically position itself so the entire molecule is visible with a small margin (~10% padding).\n\n**What currently happens:** The camera distance calculation exists but doesn't produce the correct result. Molecules either appear too small or too large, requiring manual zoom.\n\n## Technical Background\n\n\"Zoom to extents\" (also called \"fit to screen\" or \"auto-fit\") is a standard feature in all professional 3D viewers:\n- PyMOL: `zoom` command\n- ChimeraX: `view` command\n- VMD: \"Reset View\" button\n- Blender: Numpad . (period)\n\nThe algorithm:\n1. Compute bounding box/sphere of the molecule\n2. Calculate optimal camera distance: `dist = radius / tan(FOV/2)`\n3. Add padding factor (typically 1.1-1.2)\n4. Position camera at that distance, looking at center\n\n## Current Code Analysis\n\n**File:** `/packages/web/src/components/Model3DView.tsx`\n**Lines:** 376-394\n\n```tsx\n// ZOOM TO EXTENTS: Calculate optimal camera distance\nconst fovRad = (camera.fov * Math.PI) / 180;\nconst optimalDist = (structureData.radius / Math.tan(fovRad / 2)) * 1.2;\nconst dist = Math.max(optimalDist, structureData.radius * 1.5);\n\ncamera.position.set(\n  dist * 0.7,  // ← PROBLEM: These factors reduce the actual distance\n  dist * 0.5,\n  dist * 0.7\n);\n```\n\nThe issue is in the camera positioning. While `dist` is calculated correctly, the position is set at `(0.7, 0.5, 0.7)` of that distance, which is closer than intended.\n\n## Solution\n\n1.

Command palette, analysis menus, overlays, and help systems.\n\n## Why This Matters\nThe keyboard-first design requires a sophisticated command palette and hotkey system. Analysis overlays are how users extract insights from sequences. Without this layer, the app is just a viewer, not an explorer.\n\n## Design Principles\n1. **Every action has a hotkey** - No mouse-required features\n2. **Fuzzy search everywhere** - Command palette, search, menus\n3. **Modal consistency** - All panels behave the same way\n4. **Layer stacking** - Multiple overlays can be active\n\n## Deliverables\n1. **Command Palette** - Fuzzy search, keyboard navigation, `:` trigger\n2. **Analysis Menu** - Drawer with all analysis options\n3. **Simulation Hub** - Modal launcher for simulations\n4. **Layer 1 Overlays** - GC, complexity, bendability, promoter, repeat\n5. **Multi-Overlay Manager** - Stack management, z-index, focus trap\n6. **Help Overlay** - Dynamic hotkey reference\n\n## Component Architecture\n\n### Command Palette\n```\nFeatures:\n- Fuzzy search with highlighting\n- Category grouping (theme:, overlay:, sim:, export:)\n- Recent commands\n- Keyboard navigation (↑↓, Enter, Tab complete)\n- Cyberpunk styling (glow, scanlines)\n```\n\n### Overlay Stack Manager\n```typescript\nclass OverlayStackManager {\n  push(overlay): void      // Add overlay to stack\n  pop(id?): void           // Remove overlay\n  toggle(overlay): void    // Toggle overlay visibility\n  getTopmost(): Overlay    // For focus management\n  hasBlockingModal(): bool // Prevent background interaction\n}\n```\n\n### Panel System\n```\nPositions: left, right, bottom, center\nSizes: sm, md, lg, xl, full\nFeatures:\n- Focus trapping\n- Escape to close\n- Spring animations\n- Scanline overlay decoration\n```\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] All hotkeys from TUI work in web app\n- [ ] Command palette with fuzzy search\n- [ ] Overlays toggle correctly with hotkeys\n- [ ] Multiple overlays can stack visually\n- [ ] Panel animations are smooth (60fps)\n- [ ] Help overlay shows all current hotkeys\n- [ ] Focus trap works for modals\n\n## Hotkey Parity Checklist\n```\nNavigation: ↑↓←→, hjkl, gg, G, Ctrl+g\nView: Space, 1/2/3, f, t, T, d, m, M, z\nOverlays: g, x, b, p, r, J, L, V, Y, 0\nPanels: a/A, S, :, w/W, /, s, ?, Ctrl+p\n```\n\n## Risks \u0026 Mitigations\n- **Risk**: Fuzzy search performance with many commands\n  - **Mitigation**: Use efficient algorithm (fzy/fzf-style)\n- **Risk**: Focus management complexity\n  - **Mitigation**: Use React focus trap library, test thoroughly\n- **Risk**: Animation performance\n  - **Mitigation**: Use CSS transforms, avoid layout thrashing\n\n## Dependencies\n- Phase 0 (keyboard manager)\n- Phase 2 (core visualization to overlay on)","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-12-07T16:56:15.528715-05:00","updated_at":"2025-12-07T21:09:35.227829-05:00","closed_at":"2025-12-07T21:09:35.227829-05:00","source_repo":".","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"phage_explorer-ee1","depends_on_id":"phage_explorer-87z","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-07T17:04:32.337246-05:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"phage_explorer-ee1","depends_on_id":"phage_explorer-10p","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-07T17:04:33.281302-05:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}

Novelty: 9/10, Pedagogical: 9/10, Cool Factor: 10/10.","notes":"## CHAOS GAME REPRESENTATION (CGR) FRACTAL FINGERPRINTS\n\n**Comprehensive Feature Specification from Roadmap**\n\n### Concept\nThe Chaos Game Representation transforms a linear DNA sequence into a 2D fractal image encoding the complete k-mer frequency spectrum in a single visual fingerprint. Based on H. Joel Jeffrey's 1990 algorithm using an Iterated Function System (IFS):\n\n**Algorithm**: Assign nucleotides to unit square corners (A=top-left, T=top-right, G=bottom-right, C=bottom-left). Start at center. For each nucleotide, move halfway toward its corner and place a point. After k steps, point location uniquely encodes the last k nucleotides.\n\n**Biological Insights Revealed**:\n- CpG suppression (void in CG corner region - methylation signature)\n- Codon bias (highly expressed genes cluster in preferred codon regions)\n- Repetitive elements (unusually bright spots = high local k-mer frequency)\n- Horizontal gene transfer (texture discontinuities = mosaic ancestry)\n- Strand asymmetry (leading vs lagging strand preferences)\n\n### Mathematical Foundations\n\n**CGR Iteration Map**:\nGiven corners: A=(0,0), T=(1,0), C=(0,1), G=(1,1)\nStarting: P0 = (0.5, 0.5)\nFor each nucleotide ni: Pi = (Pi-1 + corner(ni)) / 2\n\n**K-mer to Coordinate Mapping (Bijective)**:\nx = sum(i=1 to k) xi / 2^i   (xi = corner_x(si))\ny = sum(i=1 to k) yi / 2^i   (yi = corner_y(si))\nEvery point in [0,1]^2 corresponds to a unique infinite k-mer.\n\n**Frequency CGR (FCGR)**:\nDiscretize unit square into 2^k x 2^k grid. Each cell counts k-mer occurrences:\n- k=3: 8x8 = 64 cells (trinucleotides)\n- k=4: 16x16 = 256 cells (tetranucleotides)\n\n**Fractal Dimension**: D2 = lim(e-\u003e0) log(C(e)) / log(e)\n- Random: D2 ~ 2 (fills plane)\n- Repetitive: D2 \u003c 2 (attractors)\n\n**Comparison Metrics**: Euclidean, Pearson correlation, KL divergence, Cosine similarity\n\n### Implementation\n\n**Core Interfaces**: CGRConfig (resolution, normalize, logScale, smoothing), CGRResult (grid: Float32Array, resolution, maxCount, totalPoints, emptyFraction, entropy)\n\n**computeCGR()**: O(n) iteration, corner lookup, grid increment, entropy calculation\n\n**compareCGR()**: Euclidean distance, Pearson correlation, cosine similarity\n\n**Braille TUI Rendering**: Unicode Braille (0x2800 base) for 8x resolution boost. Heat map coloring.\n\n**Interactive**: Zoom k-mer space, Pan, K-mer lookup, Side-by-side comparison\n\n### Assessment\n- Novelty: 9/10 - CGR + TUI + Braille + interactive zoom unprecedented\n- Pedagogical: 9/10 - IFS, bijective mappings, information theory, chaos\n- Cool Factor: 10/10 - Beautiful fractals from DNA\n\n### Files\n- packages/tui/src/components/CGRView.tsx\n- packages/core/src/analysis/cgr.ts\n- packages/core/src/analysis/cgr-compare.ts","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-12-06T23:14:47.023731-05:00","updated_at":"2025-12-08T00:31:21.341205-05:00","closed_at":"2025-12-08T00:31:21.341205-05:00","source_repo":".","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"phage_explorer-fno","depends_on_id":"phage_explorer-54g","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-06T23:14:47.025541-05:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}

Data flows into the shared Zustand store.\"\n\nThis is a **severe UX anti-pattern** for several reasons:\n1. End users don't know what SQLite, sql.js, or Zustand are\n2. It wastes valuable screen real estate\n3. It makes the app look unprofessional/unfinished\n4. It provides zero actionable information to users\n\n## Location\n\n**File:** `/packages/web/src/App.tsx`\n**Lines:** 258-265\n\n```tsx\n{repository \u0026\u0026 !error ?

The status should be implicit - if the app is working, the database is loaded.\n\n**Option A (Minimal):** Simply remove lines 258-265\n**Option B (Better UX):** Replace with a subtle loading indicator that disappears once data loads\n\n## Implementation Notes\n\n- The `isCached` badge is useful during development but meaningless to end users\n- Keep the error state display (lines 267-285) for actual error handling\n- Consider moving database status to a developer tools panel (e.g., accessible via Shift+D)\n\n## Testing\n\n1. Load the web app\n2. Verify no \"SQLite loaded\" message appears\n3. Verify error states still display correctly\n4. Verify functionality is unaffected\n\n## Definition of Done\n\n- [ ] No developer-facing messages visible in production UI\n- [ ] Error states still display when database fails to load\n- [ ] Page layout unchanged (no gaps where message was)","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-09T11:25:20.945827-05:00","updated_at":"2025-12-09T11:38:14.724697-05:00","closed_at":"2025-12-09T11:38:14.724697-05:00","source_repo":".","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"phage_explorer-l5vo","depends_on_id":"phage_explorer-jjq5","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-09T11:26:24.556485-05:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}

This is impressive for terminal art but limited in:\n- Resolution and detail\n- Smooth rotation/zoom\n- Surface rendering modes\n- Lighting and depth perception\n\nWebGL enables true 3D visualization with:\n- Smooth rotation via mouse/touch\n- Multiple rendering modes (ribbon, surface, ball-and-stick)\n- Real-time lighting\n- High-resolution detail\n\n## Technical Components\n\n### 1. WebGL Model Viewer\n\n**Technology options**:\n- **Three.js** - Full-featured 3D library, large but capable\n- **BabylonJS** - Alternative, similar capabilities\n- **Raw WebGL** - Smallest bundle, most control, most work\n\n**Recommendation**: Three.js with tree-shaking for reasonable bundle size\n\n**Features**:\n- Load PDB/mmCIF structure files\n- Multiple render modes:\n  - Ribbon (secondary structure)\n  - Surface (solvent-accessible)\n  - Ball-and-stick (atomic detail)\n  - Cartoon (simplified)\n- Color schemes:\n  - By element\n  - By residue type\n  - By chain\n  - By B-factor\n  - Custom gradients\n- Controls:\n  - Orbit (rotate around center)\n  - Pan (translate view)\n  - Zoom (scroll wheel)\n  - Reset (return to default view)\n\n### 2. Fullscreen Mode\n\n**What**: Dedicated fullscreen view for detailed structure exploration\n\n**Features**:\n- Full viewport rendering\n- Keyboard controls (arrow keys for rotation)\n- Quality presets (low/medium/high/ultra)\n- Screenshot export\n- Animation support (morph between conformations)\n\n### 3. Structure Data Integration\n\n**Sources**:\n- PDB files bundled with database\n- Fetch from RCSB PDB API\n- AlphaFold predictions\n- Local structure predictions\n\n**Caching**: Cache fetched structures in IndexedDB\n\n## Performance Considerations\n\n3D rendering is GPU-intensive:\n- Use instanced rendering for large structures\n- LOD (Level of Detail) for distant views\n- Throttle updates during rotation\n- Quality presets for different devices\n\n**Quality Presets**:\n| Preset | Target | Settings |\n|--------|--------|----------|\n| Low | Mobile, old laptops | Low poly, no shadows |\n| Medium | Average laptops | Medium detail, basic lighting |\n| High | Desktop | Full detail, shadows |\n| Ultra | Gaming PCs | Max detail, SSAO, anti-aliasing |\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- **Depends on**: Phase 1 (database for structure references)\n- **Blocks**: None (nice-to-have feature)\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n- [ ] 3D model loads and renders\n- [ ] Can rotate/zoom/pan with mouse\n- [ ] Multiple rendering modes available\n- [ ] Fullscreen mode works\n- [ ] Keyboard navigation in fullscreen\n- [ ] Performance meets 30fps minimum\n\n## Files to Create\n\n```\npackages/web/src/\n├── components/\n│   └── Model3DView.tsx              # NEW\n├── visualization/\n│   └── structure/\n│       ├── StructureRenderer.ts     # NEW (Three.js wrapper)\n│       ├── structureLoader.ts       # NEW (PDB/mmCIF parsing)\n│       └── renderModes.ts           # NEW (ribbon, surface, etc.)\n```\n\n## Estimated Complexity: High\n\n3D graphics programming is specialized. Three.js helps but there's still significant work in structure parsing, render modes, and performance optimization.","status":"open","priority":3,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-12-08T12:55:03.80212-05:00","updated_at":"2025-12-08T12:55:03.80212-05:00","source_repo":".","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"phage_explorer-mkpk","depends_on_id":"phage_explorer-7y69","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-08T12:55:22.932043-05:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}

This phase bridges the gap between our SQLite-based TUI and the browser environment.\n\n## Why This Matters\nThe phage database is the core data asset. Without efficient browser access to this data, the web app cannot function. Offline support means researchers can use the app in field conditions, on planes, or anywhere without connectivity.\n\n## Strategic Approach\nWe use **sql.js** (SQLite compiled to WebAssembly) rather than a backend API because:\n1. No server infrastructure to maintain\n2. Works offline after initial load\n3. Same database file as TUI (consistency)\n4. Near-native query performance via WASM\n\n## Deliverables\n1. **sql.js Integration** - Browser adapter in `db-runtime` package\n2. **Database Build Pipeline** - Compression, optimization, manifest\n3. **IndexedDB Caching** - Store database locally for fast reload\n4. **Service Worker** - Workbox-based offline support\n5. **State Persistence** - Browser-safe Zustand hydration\n\n## Technical Details\n\n### Database Pipeline\n```\nphage.db (source) → Optimize → Brotli compress → Chunk → manifest.json\n```\n- Target compressed size: ~10-15MB (from ~50MB)\n- Brotli quality 11 for maximum compression\n\n### Caching Strategy\n1. First visit: Fetch compressed DB from CDN\n2. Decompress and initialize sql.js\n3. Cache raw DB in IndexedDB (faster than re-decompress)\n4. Subsequent visits: Load from IndexedDB\n5. Background check for updates\n\n### Service Worker Strategy\n- **App Shell**: Precached at build time\n- **Database**: StaleWhileRevalidate (use cached, update in background)\n- **WASM modules**: CacheFirst (immutable)\n- **Fonts**: CacheFirst with long TTL\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Database loads and queries work (same results as TUI)\n- [ ] Second visit uses cached database (measurable speedup)\n- [ ] Offline mode fully functional\n- [ ] State persists across sessions\n- [ ] Database update mechanism works\n- [ ] Cold start with cached DB: \u003c1s\n\n## Risks \u0026 Mitigations\n- **Risk**: sql.js performance for large queries\n  - **Mitigation**: Precompute heavy queries, use prepared statements\n- **Risk**: IndexedDB storage limits\n  - **Mitigation**: Check quota, handle gracefully, compress if needed\n- **Risk**: Safari quirks with SharedArrayBuffer\n  - **Mitigation**: Feature detect, fall back to single-threaded mode\n\n## Dependencies\n- Phase 0 must be complete (app scaffold exists)\n- Existing `phage.db` database file","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-12-07T16:56:12.864565-05:00","updated_at":"2025-12-08T01:03:08.196808-05:00","closed_at":"2025-12-08T01:03:08.196808-05:00","source_repo":".","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"phage_explorer-pml","depends_on_id":"phage_explorer-87z","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-07T17:04:29.513114-05:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}

SequenceGrid Integration\n\n**What**: Wire the existing SequenceGridRenderer (canvas-based) to the state store\n\n**Already exists**: \n- `visualization/sequence/SequenceGridRenderer.ts` (canvas rendering)\n- `hooks/useSequenceGrid.ts` (hook interface)\n\n**Needs**:\n- Connection to store's current phage sequence\n- Scroll position synchronization with store\n- DNA/AA view mode toggle\n- Reading frame support (1, 2, 3, -1, -2, -3)\n- Diff mode highlighting for comparisons\n\n### 3. GeneMap Enhancement\n\n**What**: Complete the canvas-based gene visualization bar\n\n**Already exists**: `components/GeneMapCanvas.tsx` (partial)\n\n**Needs**:\n- Full gene data rendering (start, end, strand, name)\n- Click-to-jump functionality (click gene → scroll to position)\n- Current position indicator (vertical line showing scroll position)\n- Gene hover tooltips with detailed info\n- Proper scale bar\n\n### 4. Header/Footer Data Binding\n\n**What**: Connect existing Header/Footer layout components to live data\n\n**Header needs**:\n- Current phage name\n- Genome length\n- GC content percentage\n- Current mode indicator (NORMAL/SEARCH/COMMAND)\n\n**Footer needs**:\n- Keyboard hints (context-sensitive)\n- Pending key sequence display\n- Analysis progress indicator\n- Database load status\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- **Depends on**: Phase 1 (Core Infrastructure)\n- **Blocks**: Phase 3-7 (need core views before overlays)\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n- [ ] PhageList displays all phages with virtualized scrolling\n- [ ] Can navigate PhageList with j/k keys\n- [ ] Selecting a phage loads its sequence into SequenceGrid\n- [ ] Sequence renders smoothly at 60fps\n- [ ] Can toggle DNA/AA view with 'v' key\n- [ ] GeneMap shows genes with click-to-navigate\n- [ ] Header shows current phage info\n- [ ] Footer shows keyboard hints\n\n## Files to Create/Modify\n\n```\npackages/web/src/components/\n├── PhageList.tsx           # NEW\n├── SequenceView.tsx        # NEW (wrapper for SequenceGridRenderer)\n├── GeneMapCanvas.tsx       # ENHANCE\n├── layout/\n│   ├── Header.tsx          # MODIFY (add data binding)\n│   └── Footer.tsx          # MODIFY (add data binding)\n```\n\n## Estimated Complexity: High\n\nThis phase involves significant UI work and must feel snappy. The virtualization and canvas rendering are performance-critical.","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-12-08T12:54:55.120129-05:00","updated_at":"2025-12-08T14:20:32.964787-05:00","closed_at":"2025-12-08T14:20:32.964787-05:00","source_repo":".","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"phage_explorer-qiaq","depends_on_id":"phage_explorer-7y69","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-08T12:55:22.665918-05:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}

Update Color Palette to Modified CPK (Dark Theme Optimized)\n\n```typescript\nconst ELEMENT_COLORS: Record\u003cstring, Color\u003e = {\n  H: new Color('#f8fafc'),    // Almost white (bright on dark bg)\n  C: new Color('#64748b'),    // Slate gray (neutral backbone)\n  N: new Color('#3b82f6'),    // True blue (nitrogen)\n  O: new Color('#ef4444'),    // True red (oxygen)\n  S: new Color('#fde047'),    // Bright yellow (sulfur)\n  P: new Color('#fb923c'),    // Orange (phosphorus)\n  MG: new Color('#22c55e'),   // Green (magnesium)\n  FE: new Color('#ea580c'),   // Rust orange (iron)\n  CA: new Color('#16a34a'),   // Dark green (calcium)\n  ZN: new Color('#7c3aed'),   // Purple (zinc)\n  CL: new Color('#4ade80'),   // Lime green (chlorine)\n  NA: new Color('#a855f7'),   // Violet (sodium)\n};\n```\n\n### 2. Add Element-Based Sphere Scaling\n\n```typescript\nconst ELEMENT_RADII: Record\u003cstring, number\u003e = {\n  H: 0.25,   // Smallest\n  C: 0.40,   // Medium\n  N: 0.38,   // Slightly smaller than C\n  O: 0.35,   // Smaller than N\n  S: 0.50,   // Larger\n  P: 0.52,   // Larger\n  // ... etc\n};\n```\n\n### 3. Improve Material Properties\n\n```typescript\nconst atomMat = new MeshPhongMaterial({\n  vertexColors: true,\n  shininess: 100,        // Higher for more reflective spheres\n  specular: new Color('#ffffff'),  // White specular for better 3D feel\n});\n```\n\n## Files to Modify\n\n1. `/packages/web/src/visualization/structure-loader.ts`\n   - Update ELEMENT_COLORS\n   - Update ELEMENT_RADII\n   - Modify buildBallAndStick to use element-specific radii\n\n2. `/packages/web/src/components/Model3DView.tsx`\n   - Consider adding a color scheme selector (CPK/RasMol/Custom)\n\n## Testing\n\n- [ ] All common elements have distinct, recognizable colors\n- [ ] Works on both light and dark themes\n- [ ] Atoms are clearly distinguishable at default zoom\n- [ ] Larger structures remain readable\n\n## Definition of Done\n\n- [ ] CPK-derived color scheme implemented\n- [ ] Element-based sphere sizing\n- [ ] Clear visual distinction between C, N, O, S, P\n- [ ] Materials optimized for visibility on dark backgrounds","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-09T11:25:47.574575-05:00","updated_at":"2025-12-09T11:41:09.001156-05:00","closed_at":"2025-12-09T11:41:09.001156-05:00","source_repo":".","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"phage_explorer-qm08","depends_on_id":"phage_explorer-vru3","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-09T11:26:23.563205-05:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}

Centers on receptor-binding lineage and host-range prediction.\n\n**What This Feature Does:**\n- Embeds tail fiber proteins using protein language models (ESM/ProtT5)\n- Clusters similar fibers to identify tropism families\n- Maps clusters to known receptors (LPS, OmpA, FhuA, etc.)\n- Predicts host-range breadth from receptor diversity\n\n### Build Plan\n\n**Step 1: Protein Embedding**\n```python\nfrom esm import pretrained\nmodel, alphabet = pretrained.load_model_and_alphabet('esm2_t33_650M_UR50D')\n# Embed tail fiber sequences\nembeddings = model(tail_fiber_seqs)\n```\n\n**Step 2: Clustering**\n```python\nimport hdbscan\nimport umap\n\n# Reduce dimensions\nreducer = umap.UMAP(n_components=2, metric='cosine')\nembedding_2d = reducer.fit_transform(embeddings)\n\n# Cluster\nclusterer = hdbscan.HDBSCAN(min_cluster_size=5)\nlabels = clusterer.fit_predict(embedding_2d)\n```\n\n**Step 3: Receptor Matching**\n- HMM profiles for known receptor-binding domains\n- Host surface proteome database\n- Confidence scoring: embedding cosine + domain match + literature support\n\n### TUI Visualization\n\n```\n╭─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮\n│  TAIL FIBER TROPISM \u0026 RECEPTOR ATLAS: Lambda Phage                          │\n├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤\n│                                                                             │\n│  Tail Fiber Cluster: LamB-family (87% confidence)                           │\n│                                                                             │\n│  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐    │\n│  │  TROPISM MAP                                                        │    │\n│  │                                                                     │    │\n│  │     [LamB]──●──[OmpC]      Current phage: ●                        │    │\n│  │        ╲   │   ╱           Cluster members: ○                      │    │\n│  │         ╲  │  ╱                                                    │    │\n│  │   [FhuA]──○──○──[BtuB]     Edge = receptor overlap                │    │\n│  │           │   ╲                                                    │    │\n│  │           ○    ╲                                                   │    │\n│  │         ╱       [FepA]                                            │    │\n│  │      [Tsx]                                                        │    │\n│  │                                                                     │    │\n│  └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘    │\n│                                                                             │\n│  Predicted Receptors:                                                       │\n│  ├─ 1.

For each domain hit:\n     - E-value \u003c 1e-5 (significant)\n     - Coverage \u003e 60% of HMM model\n     - No envelope overlap with higher-scoring hits\nOutput: domain annotations with Pfam accession, name, positions, bit score\n```\n\n**Domain occurrence matrix:**\n```\nLet D = {d₁, d₂, ..., dₘ} = all detected domains\nLet P = {p₁, p₂, ..., pₙ} = all phages\n\nOccurrence matrix O[m × n]:\n  O[i,j] = count of domain dᵢ in phage pⱼ\n\nPresence/absence matrix B[m × n]:\n  B[i,j] = 1 if O[i,j] \u003e 0, else 0\n```\n\n**Domain co-occurrence (for clustering):**\n```\nJaccard similarity between domains:\n  J(dᵢ, dⱼ) = |phages with both| / |phages with either|\n\nDomains with high Jaccard often function together.\nCluster with MCL (Markov Cluster Algorithm) to find domain modules.\n```\n\n**Chord diagram layout:**\n```\nPhages arranged on circle (0 to 2π): θᵢ = 2π × i / n\nFor each shared domain connecting phages pᵢ and pⱼ:\n  Draw Bezier curve from θᵢ to θⱼ\n  Control points at circle center (creates arc shape)\nArc thickness ∝ number of shared copies or sequence identity\n```\n\n### Implementation Approach\n\n**Domain hit storage:**\n```typescript\ninterface DomainHit {\n  pfamId: string;\n  pfamName: string;\n  clanId?: string;\n  proteinId: string;\n  phageId: number;\n  start: number;\n  end: number;\n  score: number;\n  eValue: number;\n  description: string;\n}\n```\n\n**Domain sharing computation:**\n```typescript\ninterface DomainSharing {\n  domain: string;\n  phageA: number;\n  phageB: number;\n  copiesA: number;\n  copiesB: number;\n  averageIdentity: number;\n}\n\n// Find all pairwise sharings across phages\n// Group by domain family for filtering\n```\n\n**MCL clustering for domain modules:**\n```typescript\ninterface DomainCluster {\n  id: number;\n  domains: string[];\n  name: string;  // Inferred function\n  phageCount: number;\n}\n\n// Build adjacency from co-occurrence Jaccard\n// MCL iterations: expand (matrix multiply) + inflate (element-wise power)\n// Extract clusters from converged matrix\n```\n\n**ASCII Braille chord renderer:**\n```typescript\n// Braille characters give 2x4 dots per cell = high resolution curves\n// placeBraillePoint() sets individual dots in character grid\n// Bezier curves drawn point-by-point through center\n// Result: smooth arcs connecting phages on outer ring\n```\n\n### TUI Visualization\n\n```\nProtein Domain Chord Plot: Lambda + T4 + T7 + P22 + Phi29\n═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\n\n              Lambda\n                ╱╲\n              ╱    ╲\n           ⡠⠊      ⠑⡄\n         ⡰⠁          ⠑⡄\n       ⡠⠃              ⠘⡄\n      ⡜                  ⠘⡄           Selected: HTH_3 (Helix-turn-helix)\n    ⡰⠁                    ⠑⡄           Found in: Lambda (cI), P22 (c2)\n   ⡜                        ⠘⡄          Function: DNA-binding repressor\n  ⡜                          ⠘⡄\n ⡔    T4                 P22   ⠢⡀\n⡎      ⠑⢄                ⡠⠊      ⠱⡀\n⡇        ⠑⢄            ⡠⠊        ⠱⡀\n⡇          ⠑⢄        ⡠⠊          ⢱\n⡇            ⠑⢄    ⡠⠊            ⢱\n⡇              ⠑⢄⡠⠊              ⢱\n⠘⡄              ⡜               ⡰⠁\n ⠘⡄            ⡜               ⡰⠁\n  ⠘⡄          ⡜               ⡰⠁\n   ⠑⡄        ⡜              ⡰⠁\n    ⠑⡄      ⡜   Phi29     ⡠⠊\n     ⠑⡄    ⡜            ⡠⠊\n       ⠑⡄⡰⠁          ⡠⠊\n         ⠱⡀        ⡠⠊\n           T7───────⠁\n\n───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nDomain Summary:\n┌─────────────┬──────────────────────────────┬────────┬─────────────────┐\n│ Domain      │ Phages                       │ Copies │ Function        │\n├─────────────┼──────────────────────────────┼────────┼─────────────────┤\n│ Phage_cap_E │ Lambda, T4, T7, P22, Phi29   │   8    │ Capsid protein  │\n│ HTH_3       │ Lambda, P22                  │   2    │ DNA binding     │\n│ Phage_tail  │ Lambda, T4, P22              │  12    │ Tail structure  │\n│ DNA_pol_B   │ T4, T7, Phi29                │   3    │ DNA replication │\n│ Peptidase_M │ Lambda, T4, T7, P22          │   4    │ Lysis           │\n└─────────────┴──────────────────────────────┴────────┴─────────────────┘\n\nLegend: ━ Core (all phages)  ─ Common (3-4)  ╌ Rare (2)\n\n[Tab] Cycle domains  [Enter] Show alignment  [F] Filter by clan  [ESC] Exit\n```\n\n### Why This Is Good\n\n1. **Domain-level evolution**: Genes evolve, but domains are truly modular units. Domain sharing reveals deeper relationships.\n2. **Function transfer mechanism**: Which domains spread through phage populations.\n3. **Protein engineering hints**: Domain X appears with domain Y = may function together.\n4. **Beautiful data reduction**: Thousands of genes → dozens of domains → one elegant visualization.\n5. **Novel TUI visualization**: Chord diagrams in terminals are rare; Braille curves push ASCII art boundaries.\n\n### Innovation Assessment\n\n**Novelty: HIGH** - Chord diagrams exist (Circos), but no TUI implementation. ASCII/Braille curve rendering is novel. Interactive domain filtering is new.\n\n**Pedagogical Value: 9/10** - Teaches protein domains, HMM profiles, modular evolution, network visualization.\n\n**Wow Factor: 9/10** - Smooth Braille curves connecting distant phages through shared domains is visually stunning.\n\n### Data Requirements\n- HMMER + Pfam-A database for domain detection (offline preprocessing)\n- Pre-computed domain_hits table in SQLite\n- ~50MB additional data for Pfam profiles","status":"open","priority":3,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-12-06T23:20:17.342284-05:00","updated_at":"2025-12-06T23:43:59.044724-05:00","source_repo":".","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"phage_explorer-ujh","depends_on_id":"phage_explorer-54g","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-06T23:20:17.344679-05:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}

Simulations show **how** it behaves:\n\n1. **Lysogeny Decision** - Lambda switch between lysis and lysogeny\n2. **Ribosome Traffic** - Translation dynamics and codon effects\n3. **Plaque Formation** - Spatial spread through bacterial lawn\n4. **Evolution** - Mutation and selection over generations\n5. **Infection Kinetics** - Population dynamics during infection\n6. **Packaging Motor** - DNA packaging into capsid\n\nThese simulations make abstract genomic features tangible and educational.\n\n## Current State\n\n### Visualizers (Exist in web)\n- ✅ LysogenyVisualizer - CI/Cro concentration dynamics\n- ✅ RibosomeVisualizer - Ribosome traffic flow\n- ✅ PlaqueVisualizer - 2D cellular automata\n- ✅ EvolutionVisualizer - Phylogenetic replay\n- ✅ TimeControls - Play/pause/speed controls\n\n### Missing\n- ❌ InfectionKineticsVisualizer\n- ❌ PackagingMotorVisualizer\n- ❌ SimulationView - Unified container\n\n### Infrastructure (Exists)\n- ✅ useSimulation hook\n- ✅ SimulationHub overlay\n- ⚠️ Worker integration (partial)\n\n## Technical Components\n\n### 1.

Worker Integration\n\n**What**: Connect simulation engines to Web Workers\n\n**Why workers**: Simulations can be CPU-intensive; blocking the main thread kills UI responsiveness\n\n**Pattern**:\n```typescript\n// In worker\nconst sim = new LysogenySimulation(params);\nwhile (running) {\n  sim.step();\n  postMessage({ state: sim.getState() });\n  await sleep(16); // 60fps target\n}\n\n// In component\nconst state = useSimulation('lysogeny', params);\n```\n\n### 3.

The goal is not mere replication but intelligent adaptation—leveraging the unique strengths of each platform.\n\n## Background \u0026 Rationale\n\n### Current State Analysis\n\n**TUI (Terminal UI) - 1100+ lines App.tsx**\n- 50+ components, 40+ specialized analysis overlays\n- 6 fully-implemented interactive simulations\n- 56+ keyboard shortcuts across 7 categories\n- Progressive experience system (novice→intermediate→power)\n- Complete genomic analysis toolkit\n\n**Web (Browser) - Current State**\n- 43 overlay types defined, many incomplete\n- 10 simulation types registered, visualizers partial\n- 40+ keyboard shortcuts (good coverage)\n- Mobile support exists but cell sizes problematic\n- Canvas rendering works but needs optimization\n\n### The Gap\n\n1. **Mobile UX**: Cells too small for letters at default zoom; orientation changes not leveraged\n2. **Analysis Overlays**: ~12 overlays incomplete or missing visualizations\n3. **Simulation Visualizers**: 6 simulations need complete visualization components\n4. **Progressive Disclosure**: Experience gating exists in state but not wired to UI\n5. **3D Model**: Quality presets work but mobile-specific optimizations missing\n\n## Strategic Goals\n\n1. **100% Feature Parity**: Every TUI feature accessible via Web\n2. **Mobile-First Excellence**: Touch-optimized, orientation-aware, readable at all sizes\n3. **World-Class UX**: Discoverable, learnable, powerful\n4. **Performance**: 60fps rendering, \u003c100ms interactions, offline-capable\n5. **Accessibility**: WCAG AA compliance, keyboard-only navigation, screen reader support\n\n## Success Metrics\n\n- All 40+ TUI overlays functional in Web\n- All 6 simulations with complete visualizers\n- Mobile NPS \u003e 50 (Net Promoter Score)\n- Lighthouse Performance \u003e 90\n- Time-to-Interactive \u003c 3s on 3G\n\n## Architecture Principles\n\n1. **Shared Core**: Maximum code reuse via @phage-explorer/core\n2. **Platform Adaptation**: TUI-optimized ≠ Web-optimized; adapt intelligently\n3. **Progressive Enhancement**: Core features work without JS; enhanced with it\n4. **Lazy Loading**: Load analysis algorithms on-demand via Web Workers\n5. **Responsive First**: Design mobile, enhance for desktop\n\n## Pillars of Work\n\n### Pillar 1: Mobile Sequence Grid Excellence\nFix the current mobile grid issues and make it genuinely useful for genomic exploration.\n\n### Pillar 2: Responsive \u0026 Orientation-Aware Layout  \nIntelligent layout adaptation for portrait/landscape and all device sizes.\n\n### Pillar 3: Complete Analysis Overlay Parity\nImplement all 40+ TUI overlays with Web-optimized visualizations.\n\n### Pillar 4: Simulation Visualizer Parity\nComplete all 6 simulation visualizers with interactive controls.\n\n### Pillar 5: Keyboard/Command Parity\nEnsure all TUI hotkeys work in Web with proper conflict resolution.\n\n### Pillar 6: Progressive Disclosure \u0026 UX Polish\nWire experience levels to UI, implement onboarding, feature tours.\n\n### Pillar 7: 3D Visualization Parity\nMobile-optimized 3D with LOD, touch controls, quality presets.\n\n### Pillar 8: Performance \u0026 Offline\nService worker optimization, lazy loading, cache strategies.\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- Existing @phage-explorer/core algorithms (complete)\n- Existing @phage-explorer/state store (complete)  \n- Web Workers infrastructure (exists, needs expansion)\n- Canvas rendering system (exists, needs optimization)\n\n## Timeline Estimate\n\nNot providing time estimates per project guidelines. Work should be prioritized by impact and dependencies.\n\n## Risk Factors\n\n1. WebGL/WebGPU compatibility across mobile browsers\n2. Memory constraints on older mobile devices\n3. Touch gesture conflicts with browser gestures\n4. IndexedDB storage limits for large genomes\n","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-12-09T00:33:27.756677-05:00","updated_at":"2025-12-09T00:33:27.756677-05:00","source_repo":"."}

This needs investigation and verification.\n\n## Current State\n\n### Phage Catalog\n**File:** `/packages/data-pipeline/src/phage-catalog.ts`\n\nThe catalog includes 12 phages with PDB IDs:\n\n| Phage | Accession | PDB IDs |\n|-------|-----------|---------|\n| Lambda | NC_001416.1 | 7VI9, 8K35 |\n| T4 | NC_000866.4 | 5VF3 |\n| T7 | NC_001604.1 | 3J4G |\n| PhiX174 | NC_001422.1 | 2BPA |\n| MS2 | NC_001417.2 | 2MS2 |\n| M13 | NC_003287.2 | 2MJZ |\n| P22 | NC_002371.2 | 5UU5 |\n| Phi29 | NC_011048.1 | 1MN8 |\n| Mu | NC_000929.1 | 4FCY, 1WRU, 5YVQ |\n| Phi6 | NC_003714.1 | 4BTG |\n| SPbeta | NC_001884.1 | 5Y24, 6HP7, 5XYB |\n| T5 | NC_005859.1 | 8ZVI, 6OMC, 5TJT |\n\nLambda IS in the catalog. So why isn't it showing?\n\n## Investigation Tasks\n\n### 1. Check Database Build\nVerify the phage.db contains all 12 phages:\n```bash\nbun run build:db\nsqlite3 phage.db \"SELECT name, pdb_ids FROM phages ORDER BY name\"\n```\n\n### 2. Check Web Repository Query\n**File:** `/packages/web/src/db/SqlJsRepository.ts`\n\nVerify `listPhages()` returns all phages:\n```typescript\nconst result = this.db.exec(`\n  SELECT id, name, accession, family, ...\n  FROM phages\n  ORDER BY name\n`);\n```\n\n### 3. Check 3D Model Loading\nFor each phage, verify:\n1. `phage.pdbIds` array is populated\n2. First PDB ID resolves to a valid RCSB URL\n3. Structure loads without error\n\n### 4. RCSB Availability\nSome older PDB entries may have been superseded or removed. Check each PDB ID:\n```bash\nfor pdb in 7VI9 8K35 5VF3 3J4G 2BPA 2MS2 2MJZ 5UU5 1MN8 4FCY 4BTG 5Y24 8ZVI; do\n  curl -s -o /dev/null -w \"%{http_code} $pdb\\n\" https://files.rcsb.org/download/$pdb.pdb\ndone\n```\n\n## Potential Issues\n\n### Issue 1: Database Not Rebuilt\nIf `bun run build:db` hasn't been run after catalog updates, the database may be stale.\n\n### Issue 2: JSON Parsing\nPDB IDs are stored as JSON in SQLite. Check parsing:\n```typescript\npdbIds: safeJsonParse\u003cstring[]\u003e(phage.pdbIds, []),\n```\n\n### Issue 3: Web App Cache\nIndexedDB may have cached an older database version.\n\n## Remediation Steps\n\n1. **Rebuild database:**\n   ```bash\n   rm phage.db\n   bun run build:db\n   ```\n\n2. **Clear web app cache:**\n   - Open DevTools \u003e Application \u003e IndexedDB\n   - Delete phage-explorer database\n   - Reload\n\n3. **Verify all phages load:**\n   - Each phage should appear in the list\n   - Each phage with PDB IDs should show 3D model\n\n## Testing Checklist\n\n- [ ] Lambda phage appears in the list\n- [ ] Lambda 3D model loads (PDB 7VI9 or 8K35)\n- [ ] All 12 catalog phages appear\n- [ ] All 12 phages have working 3D models\n- [ ] No console errors during structure loading\n\n## Definition of Done\n\n- [ ] All 12 catalog phages visible in web UI\n- [ ] All phages with PDB IDs load 3D structures\n- [ ] Any missing/broken PDB IDs replaced with alternatives\n- [ ] Database rebuild script works correctly","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-09T11:25:47.724489-05:00","updated_at":"2025-12-09T11:44:14.817108-05:00","closed_at":"2025-12-09T11:44:14.817108-05:00","source_repo":".","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"phage_explorer-z49z","depends_on_id":"phage_explorer-vru3","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-09T11:26:23.617718-05:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}

Swipe Gestures\n\n**Horizontal Swipe (on sequence view)**\n- Swipe left: Scroll sequence forward\n- Swipe right: Scroll sequence backward\n- Velocity-based: Fast swipe = momentum scrolling\n\n**Horizontal Swipe (on phage list)**\n- Swipe left on item: Quick actions (compare, details)\n- Swipe right on item: Mark/favorite\n\n**Vertical Swipe (on drawer)**\n- Swipe up: Expand drawer\n- Swipe down: Dismiss drawer\n\n### 2. Pinch Gestures\n\n**Pinch on sequence view**\n- Pinch in: Zoom out (see more bases)\n- Pinch out: Zoom in (see fewer bases, larger)\n- Center zoom on pinch midpoint\n\n**Pinch on 3D view**\n- Pinch in: Zoom camera out\n- Pinch out: Zoom camera in\n\n### 3. Long-Press Gestures\n\n**Long-press on amino acid**\n- Show amino acid HUD with detailed information\n- Hold to keep visible, release to dismiss\n\n**Long-press on FAB**\n- Open full feature modal directly\n\n**Long-press on phage in list**\n- Show context menu (compare, export, details)\n\n### 4.
