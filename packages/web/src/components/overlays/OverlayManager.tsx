  // The TUI App.tsx keeps 'sequence' in local state.
  
  // For now, let's assume the store might be updated to hold sequence or we fetch it.
  // Or we can try to get it from the repository if we had access.
  
  // To make progress without refactoring the whole app state, I'll mock the sequence or use a placeholder if empty.
  // Ideally, the Web App should mirror the TUI App structure regarding data fetching.
  
  // Let's check if I can get sequence from somewhere. 
  // In TUI App.tsx: const [sequence, setSequence] = useState<string>('');
  // So it's local state there.
  
  // I will assume for this task that I just render the overlays. 
  // If data is missing, they will just show "No sequence loaded" which is fine.
